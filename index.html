      <p>
        I am a human-computer interaction researcher, with a focus on creativity and writing assistants. My thesis focused on how creative writers make use of language models, but recently I've become more interested in the ethics of data collection, how to create and support community models (i.e. models created outside of and in resistance to corporate models), and the impact of langauge models on ownership, agency, and learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in Computer Science with <a href="https://glassmanlab.seas.harvard.edu/glassman.html" target="_blank">Elena Glassman</a> at Harvard University, as well as a Fellow with the <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Library Innovation Lab</a>. I completed my PhD at Columbia University with <a href="https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~chilton/chilton.html" target="_blank">Lydia Chilton</a> in 2022. I have been supported by an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=191361" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>, the <a href="https://brown.columbia.edu/portfolio/seed-grants/" target="_blank">Brown Institute for Media Innovation</a>, and an Amazon Research Award. I'll be joining faculty at the School of Computer Science at the University of Sydney in July, 2025. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a poet and essayist. My first book of poetry, The Anxiety of Conception (Nothing to Say Press, 2025), will come out next year. In 2020 I was named a <a href="https://brooklynpoets.org/poet/katy-ilonka-gero/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Poets Fellow</a> and was a 2020-2021 <a href=
        https://www.culturehub.org/katy-ilonka-gero
         target="_blank">CultureHub Resident Contributing Writer</a>. I was a Writer in Residence at the <a href="https://vermontstudiocenter.org/" target="_blank">Vermont Studio Center</a> in 2022. I used to be on the editorial team for <a href="https://taper.badquar.to/" target="_blank">taper</a>, a literary magazine for small computational pieces; now I co-edit <a href="http://www.ensemblepark.com/" target="_blank">Ensemble Park</a> with Kyle Booten, a literary magazine that collects experiments in human-computer co-writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to build machines and sensors. I hold a Bachelors of Science in mechanical engineering from MIT, where I recieved the Carl G. Sontheimer Prize for Excellence in Innovation and Creativity for my work on soft robotics. I worked at two startups: Rest Devices (we built baby monitors) and Soofa (we built smart city furniture).

      <p>I am broadly interested in creative writing and language models. In particular I want to understand how computer-generated text impacts the writing process, and how it can support writerly values like iteration, exploration, agency, joy, and learning. Recently, I have become interested in the ethics of data collection, and how we might create language models that support writers and writerly values by, e.g., building community models trained on consensually shared data, or showing connections between model outputs and the writing most influential in creating those outputs.</p>

      <h3>PhD Materials</h3>
      <p>During my PhD, I was always looking for people's materials (thesis proposal, fellowship application essays, etc.) to use as examples, particularly anyone whose thesis was similar to mine either in content/subject area or form. Here are my own materials, for those looking for examples:</p>

</svg> ART & WRITING</h2>
      <p>I have created some freely available writing tools. These tools range from a simple website that will rearrange the lines of your poem, to custom generated thesauruses based on different styles and topics. Poetry is often about seeing the familiar anew, and computation provides a way to interact with your own writing in curious and foreign ways.</p>

      <ul class='writing-tools callout list-unstyled tabbed'></ul>

      <p>My poems, essays, and small computational pieces have been published in a variety of venues, as well as been performed live. I'm interested in computation as a way to deepen how we can experience literature, but I'm also invested in writing as a manual, human process. When computation enters my work, I prioritize the beauty of language over the concept of the algorithm, and in this way I often feel more aligned with the concrete poets than the computational ones. I love the browser as a place of play, and see websites as a medium worth taking seriously.</p>

      <p>I curate a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B9AWI6OCtClxu1WnuXJgq6at0dvIdJwviksExzw0TDA/edit" target="_blank">list of publications</a> that accept computational poetry.</p>
