abstract = {People are increasingly getting information and news from social media. On Twitter we are seeing the emergence of "tweetorials" -- long, explanatory Twitter threads written by experts. In this work we study tweetorials as a form of science writing. While scientists have begun to champion the importance of Twitter as a science communication medium, few have studied how people are successfully using this medium to communicate complex and nuanced ideas. To understand how tweetorials work, we curated a collection of 46 clear and engaging tweetorials from multiple domains. We analyzed these tweetorials for the writing techniques that they employ, and found that while tweetorials use many traditional science writing techniques, they also use more subjective language, actively build credibility, and incorporate media in unique ways. In addition, we report on a workshop we ran to aid science PhD students in writing tweetorials, and find that while providing common tweetorial techniques improves their writing, the students still struggle to balance their scientific sensibilities with the informal tone associated with tweetorials. We discuss the implications of using informal and subjective language in science communication, as well as how technology can support scientists in writing tweetorials.},
