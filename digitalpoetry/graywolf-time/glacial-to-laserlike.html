      <p>The poem comes to you in a dream, on the bus, while staring at the wall. It emerges, becomes familiar. The words become your own. That turn of phrase, that perfect image. Seared into your mind. Then, you're not paying attention, you're looking elsewhere---it leaves. You forget a word or two, a line, the volta, what was it? The poem recedes. You don't recognize it anymore. 
      </p>
      <p>Try to see your poem like a glacier does. Or see it on the timescale of a beam of light. The only important thing is to see it anew.</p>

      <textarea class="poem" id="raw">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

Then took the other, as just as fair,
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,

And both that morning equally lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.

I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.</textarea><br>
