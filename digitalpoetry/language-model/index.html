      <p class="lead">Below is a story written in collaboration with myself. I trained a language model on my own writing: a mix of diary entries, poetry and essay drafts, unfinished ideas, and long emails I've written to friends. 
      <p class="lead">I then use this language model to generate text, a kind of machine-mediated automatic writing, perhaps more uninhibited than traditional automatic writing because there is no way for me to get in the way of myself. I use this text as a starting point for the story, which I collage and edit into a coherent piece.</p>
      <p class="lead">It is in this way that the story is collaboratively written with myself.</p>

      <p>I've never written a story that I'm proud of. I wouldn't know how to write it. But the story is always there, like the voices in my head, waiting to be heard. My struggle is not about the words on the page, it's what I think I am doing with the words. I was reading an article about a new way to start writing. Instead of staring at the blank page, the author suggests reading a book you don't feel comfortable with, even if you've been in the habit of abandoning such books. Maybe I'm just not writing into my discomfort. Maybe I'm unable to see the book that I am.

      <p>I want to write about myself, and the way I get up but so often feel tired, and the way I can't stop talking to the people I'm in love with, and the way the people I'm in love with keep changing. But I don't have all the words, and I'm not always sure I would want those words read. (Plus, sometimes I lose the words I have. They get let loose onto the page with ever-expanding caesuras tearing them apart.) This all sounds like a lot of work, not so much for me to write (though maybe also that) but for me to sit with and think about. So instead I write around myself, great looping sentences that swerve and arc. Have you ever done that exercise where you draw an ever-expanding spiral, trying to keep your lines as close together as possible but also not touching? (Mine always end up looking like the cross-section of a tree trunk.) This is like that.

      <p>For this story I want to write, I try to consider the stories I love. But what I love is not always given. I'm not sure why I love what I love, or rather my love shifts constantly, light dappling through water onto the sand. I fear this light, ever moving, never repeating, fractalled and infinite like a tireless writer wringing out letters into words into paragraphs of song. If I don't know what I love, how will I know where to go next?

      <p>Shifting light through water is a strange thing. Like there is something in the sand that keeps the water around. I wonder how M would see that strange light, if it becomes a figure, or a study. She told me there isn't much difference between her sketchbook and the art she tries to sell. It's all an exercise. This is just practice. I practiced loving her, and then I got too good at it. That love was so much better than art, but I can't claim to have made it. 

      <p>Falling in love lies like a wintered-out reminder of the summer I had at home, with M, in backyards and in cars, on her shoulders, on the roof, along the side of the woods. The air was so blue and the hot rain was a voice pulling me up. I came from the ocean, that salty air, the sound of the water. I cannot just sit on the edge of the ocean, so far and so close. I can only lie, or rather bend this language. I can only be in my own mind. I cannot just say I want to be like her. I cannot just say I want to be with her. And later, I cannot just cry as much as I want to cry. I cannot just think about her. I cannot just say I loved her. I cannot just say I wanted to find her. I cannot just have my closed eyes.
