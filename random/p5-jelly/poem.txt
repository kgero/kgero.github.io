The Jellyfish

Imagine having so many arms they tangle 
far below or above, 
a soft shimmy
that glimmers 
in the dark.
The water pushes into 
its bell-shaped body, 
wanting to be wherever it rests.
This is why the ocean barely bothers with gravity
and you slip in like a second home,
the memory of air
beading on your skin 
as your legs kick 
into another life. 

But you are no sea creature
and the jellyfish is an old, old friend.
In this ocean
that calls and calls, this
great belly of the earth, this
uncontrollable storm,
each jelly tendril courses behind
its body like a child, grasping only
what the mother allows.
