  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
  And sorry I could not travel both
  And be one traveler, long I stood
  And looked down one as far as I could
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;
  
  Then took the other, as just as fair,
  And having perhaps the better claim,
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
  Though as for that the passing there
  Had worn them really about the same,
  
  And both that morning equally lay
  In leaves no step had trodden black.
  Oh, I kept the first for another day!
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
  I doubted if I should ever come back.
  
  I shall be telling this with a sigh
  Somewhere ages and ages hence:
  Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
  I took the one less traveled by,
  And that has made all the difference.

          <b>"dis/appear"</b> is a simple tool for animating poetry over time. </p>
        <p>
          It was created by <a href="https://www.katygero.com/" target="_blank">Katy Ilonka Gero</a> and <a href="https://maxy.world/" target="_blank">Maxwell Neely-Cohen</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Try to see a poem as a glacier does. Or see it on the timescale of a beam of light. The only important thing is to see it anew.</p>
        <p>
          Please use it any way you see fit. For example you can take screen recordings of your poem in motion, or take screenshots at optimal moments for "erasure" poetics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The poem comes to you in a dream, on the bus, while staring at the wall. It emerges, becomes familiar. The words become your own. That turn of phrase, that perfect image. Seared into your mind. Then, you're not paying attention, you're looking elsewhere---it leaves. You forget a word or two, a line, the volta, what was it? The poem recedes. You don't recognize it anymore.
