The writing still feels modern, despite the dialogue clearly being dated.\n\nI did feel that sometimes Salinger was going over my head when he didn't need to, which I didn't appreciate.\u00a0For instance, in Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes, there is a twist to the story which was great but I didn't glean from the text -- I had to read about it online. I don't see the point in being so obtuse. The story was an amazing character study and being clearer with the twist at the end would not have disrupted that. I wonder if more of the nine\u00a0stories had some extra layer that I didn't catch.\n\nMany of these stories are occupied with children, particularly precocious children. This seems to be common in Salinger's writing.",

I was inspired to read it by the <a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/11/24/oliver-sacks-gratitude-book/\">Brain Pickings article</a> on the small\u00a0little thing. The essays are all short\u00a0and feel like glimpses through\u00a0windows into Oliver Sacks' great mind. I love his delight in old age:\n<blockquote>My father, who lived to be ninety-four, often said that the eighties had been one of the most enjoyable decades of his life. He felt, as I begin to feel, not a shrinking but an enlargement of mental life and perspective.</blockquote>\nUltimately they are of interest because Oliver Sacks is of interest, because Oliver Sacks is interesting. I think this must be the case for personal essays: the writer must engage you with their own self in order to take you along.",

                    "notes": "Part one of this book is great and I hope it changes my life. It outlines a theory of how habits work and how we can change them. The theory is that a habit it made up of three parts: cue, routine, and reward. The key towards changing your habits is identifying the cue and the reward, (you tend to know exactly what the routine is,) then replacing the routine with something you'd rather do that still triggers some kind of reward for you (and follows the original cue.) Apparently habits can't be erased, only overridden. The final, and necessary, concept behind habit changing is that stressful life events or particularly enticing cues can cause you to fall back into the habit you tried to change; the way to get past this is to make a plan for getting through those times\u00a0and to have a belief that you can follow it.\n\nAlthough this is simple, it's easy to see how far the theory can go in changing your life. Duhigg doesn't dive into this much, but habits control huge portions of your day and therefore your life. Taking control of them is an incredibly powerful way to take control of your life.\n\nPart two is interesting and focuses on habits in successful organizations. I thought the idea of keystone habits was strong--changing one habit can bleed into many others--as was the idea of willpower as a muscle and predictor of success. However, here he starts to delve into case studies and concepts I'm not convinced are highly related to habits. He talks a lot about data-driven marketing, which can be understood through a framework of habits of the consumer. I agree that we can frame marketing with consumer habits but I always get the feeling in these kinds of books that the author just thinks <em>everything</em> can now be understood with their\u00a0theory. I don't think habits are a particularly useful way to understand\u00a0big data.\n\nPart three goes off the deep end for me, talking about the civil rights movement and strong versus weak social ties... It just didn't feel relevant and I was already gun-shy about trying to push everything into a habits-shaped hole. I skimmed this part, which also included a comparison of a man who killed his wife while sleep walking and a woman who gambled away her and her parents fortune. I think he took on something much larger than and, again, not relevant to habit.\n\nStill, part one was awesome and totally worth it.",

I read the first three quarters early this year and though I loved it I stopped short of the end for some reason. However, I diligently returned to it after Christmas and finished it on the plane ride home. The whole thing is amazing.\n\nAnne Lamott seems\u00a0like the perfect writer: honest, articulate, and full of neuroses that make her writing unique and engaging. Bird by Bird is about writing, about how to write and what to write and why this writing thing anyway. It doesn't sugar-coat the truth. Lamott does not suggest I will get published nor that publishing is really any good, though she admits that the achievement is a little stone she carries around in her pocket.\u00a0She knows that writing must be read, that the point of articulation is the reciprocal, and she knows that for must of us that reciprocation will just be friends and family. She assures us that this is okay.\n\nBut it's also about how to sit down and write, every day. She's equal parts 'hard work and practice will get you through' and 'sometimes you have to wait for it to come.' She smatters her faith in the book in a way that does not upset me at all, and I get upset easily with that kind of stuff.\n\nThis book introduced me to Lamott and made me desperately want to read her other work.\n\nA scene that stuck in my head: when she was reworking and reworking her second novel she laid out her manuscript in little stacks on the floor, rearranging the pieces to figure out how the story should go.",

Tin House seems to be\u00a0heavy on fiction,\u00a0but it also has essays, poems, some reviews of books, and, in this issue, one comic or graphic novel short.\n\nI didn't get into any of the poetry, even though they had a lot of pieces by Sharon Olds who I thought I really liked. That's okay, I don't get into most poetry. It was all a bit too... wispy for me. Not enough grabbed onto something real that could keep me engaged and or even on point for the entire poem. I didn't finish a lot, even though they were mostly short, and though the longest poem in the bunch did engage me past the first page it went on too long without any, as far as I could gather, progression.\n\nIt had an essay I'd already read called On Pandering by Claire Vaye Watkins which stood up to a second reading well. I skipped a couple of the essays because they didn't grab me. There was an essay about a woman's romantic history, tracing back generations, which I enjoyed but felt would have been better as inspiration for fiction.\n\nI prowled through the fiction greedily. I don't read a lot of short stories, and even fewer outside the context of a single author's collection. They were all high quality, good stories and I enjoyed them, but only one stuck with me and towards the end I got tired of the format, actually skipping out on the last two. (There were a total of seven in the issue.) The one that stuck with me was Children by Helen Phillips. I happened to have seen a book of hers, The Beautiful Bureaucrats, recommended at the Harvard Book Store recently; she was described as similar to Haruki Murakami if Murakami knew how to write women. I didn't put this together until halfway through the story, which is wonderful and weird and still sticks with me vividly.",

                    "notes": "This novel chronicles the last Go game of the Master of Go in Japan as he takes on a younger challenger. It's actually mostly true, and Kawabata reported on the game for a newspaper at the time. A co-worker has been teaching a couple of us at work how to play Go, so I had a little bit of context for understanding the game which is occasionally detailed in diagrams. Specific moves are discussed\u00a0in the book. I had trouble following the game in any kind of technical capacity, but I followed the game emotionally as Kawabata lays it out. I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed the book as much if I had no understanding of the game. I think I would have.\n\nWhich is to say I loved the book. The writing style is sparse and the chapters are short. Much of the book is about the physical ailments of the competitors, especially the Master who must take a months-long recess in the middle because of a heart condition and eventually dies one year after the game. It's also about the various rules and recesses they have on top of the actual rules of the game. Because the game takes many months and is so physically intense for the players they set up procedures for breaking and returning, all of which is a kind of meta-game on top on the purity of placing pieces on the board. This is actually part metaphor for the new players of go. For the Master is it almost absurdity and the thought of strategizing the meta-game is offensive.\n\nThe game is described as a work of art and the players as artists. The book is rich with simple language but it also does not profess to higher meaning that it does not directly address. At one point, when the Master's opponent Otake wants to forfeit because he does not want to challenge the Master as he dies, Kawabata (as Uragami in the book) details his opinions of what the game means in hopes of convincing Otake\u00a0to continue. These opinions are rife with explanations of larger cultural implications of this particular game.\n\nThere is something beautiful and deeply engaging about the book that I don't fully understand how Kawabata achieved. Something about the simple straight-forward writing, the selection of details, the way you know at the beginning that the Master loses but still are gripped by the unfolding. I want to write like that.",

The main character had a personality that took me a while to find, but the story was great, the twists and turns not the focus but the background for the main character's development.\n\nI enjoyed Moonlight Shadow much more, though perhaps Kitchen prepared me for the style and I was more receptive to it. It was incredibly sad with a touch of magic realism that was almost... not beside the point or unnecessary but not the key to the story's success.

I bought it because the first page intrigued me. I bought it because the cover recommendation is from Anne Lamott.\n\nThe book read like poetry: soft, evocative, almost subconscious. Terry begins by telling you that her mother left her all her journals. After her mother died she went to read the journals, only to discover they were blank. From there the book dips and dives into various parts of Terry's life, mostly in chronological order, but all surrounding this question of voice, specifically the voice of women, specifically the voice of her mother.\n\nI loved the book. It was a beautiful, meditative read full of gems of wisdom and poignancy. Terry is\u00a0many things I am not: raised in the Mormon faith, at home\u00a0close to and in the wilderness, a women who can identify birds. Yet this did not stand me apart from her. I still thought she was talking to me.\n\nHer treatment of religion was especially interesting. Though she never explicitly discusses a loss of faith it is clear that she is no longer tied to the Mormon teachings and that she feels part of many religions and many gods. Again, though this could easily have bothered me it did not. In fact her approach almost mimics my own: that religious stories are mythology we use to understand our lives.\n<blockquote>The moment Eve bit into the Apple, her eyes opened and she became free. She exposed the truth of what every woman knows: to find our sovereign voice often requires a betrayal. We just have to make certain we do not betray ourselves. For a woman or man to speak from the truth of their heart is to break taboo. The mask is removed. The snake who tempted Eve to eat the forbidden fruit was not the devil but her own instinctive nature saying, Honor your hunger and feed yourself. -When Women Were Birds</blockquote>",

The stories and essays, for the most part, did not grab my attention. At least one I skipped after four pages of droll. The others I struggled through, trying to get something out them, trying to figure out what I was missing. The poetry also felt lacking, though I often feel that, but I came across three poems, two poets, that struck me deeply, and 3/20 isn't too bad a success rate in my experience.\n\nI will admit that getting sucked into literary magazines is hard because they jump around so much. With a collection of short stories or poetry at least the author is making a compilation for you and something, whatever makes the author unique, stays constant across the board. You can look forward to more of it. Editors of literary magazines are making compilations\u00a0as well but the material is so disparate that the kind of continuity that keeps you engaged into the next piece is almost impossible to create.\n\nThe poems I loved were by Anya Silver (<em>Maid Maleen</em> and <em>Snow White</em>) and Charles Harper Webb (<em>People Think That I'm a Gourmet Chef</em>).\n\nThere was a story at the end about a Bangladeshi immigrant in Queens that was incredibly striking and sad and had amazing voice and narrative (by Martin Cloutier). And one of the first stories about a woman trying to get her child into daycare also did a great job with voice and tone though the narrative was not as strong (by Johanna Berkman).",

I really liked the book: it's short and to the point and the author has just the right amount of sass. She talks not just about how to do user research, but how to do it given that you're probably not a professional and how to do it in organizations that might not want you to do so. Very practical.\n\nMy notes:\n\nA way to classify the purpose of your research:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Generative or exploratory: \"What's up with...?\"</li>\n\t<li>Descriptive and explanatory: \"What and how?\"</li>\n\t<li>Evaluative: \"Are we getting close?\"</li>\n\t<li>Causal: \"Why is this happening?\"</li>\n</ul>\nSetting roles, where roles represent a cluster of tasks. Single people can take on multiple roles or a role could be shared:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Author</li>\n\t<li>Interviewer/Moderator</li>\n\t<li>Coordinator/Scheduler</li>\n\t<li>Notetaker/Recorder</li>\n\t<li>Recruiter</li>\n\t<li>Analyst</li>\n\t<li>Documenter</li>\n\t<li>Observer</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Best practices:</em>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Phrase questions clearly: not the questions you're asking users but the questions you are trying to answer.</li>\n\t<li>Set realistic expectations: what's the question being answered, the methods being used, and the decisions to be informed by the findings.</li>\n\t<li>Be prepared: makes everything go cleanly and quickly.</li>\n\t<li>Allow sufficient time for analysis.</li>\n\t<li>Take dictation: notes or it didn't happen, and they need to be sufficiently informative for anyone who has to make decisions based on the research.</li>\n</ul>\n\"To make the best use of your time and truly do just enough research, try to identify your highest-priority questions--your assumptions that carry the biggest risk.\"\n\n<em>The process:</em>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Define the problem.</li>\n\t<li>Select the approach.</li>\n\t<li>Plan and prepare for the research.</li>\n\t<li>Collect the data.</li>\n\t<li>Analyze the data.</li>\n\t<li>Report the results.</li>\n</ol>\nScreening participants is important. You want to make sure they are the type of person your product/organization is looking to engage. You also want to make sure they will be an active and useful participant: not too terse but also not too distracted and verbose. You can use a simple survey and might want to follow with a quick phone call to see if they are a good match for your study.\n\nUsability testing is basically a directed interview with a representative user while they use a prototype or actual product to attempt certain tasks. Usability testing tells you whether people understand the product or service and can use it without difficulty. It does not provide you with a vision, tell you if your product or service will be successful or which user tasks are more important than others.\n\nA sample structure for an analysis session:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Setup\n-- Summarize the goals and process of the research.\n-- Describe who you spoke with and under which circumstances.\n-- Describe how you gathered the data.\n-- Describe the types of analysis you will be doing.</li>\n\t<li>Analyze!\n-- Pull out quotes and observations.\n-- Group quotes and observations that typify a repeated pattern or idea into themes.</li>\n\t<li>Synthesize\n-- Summarize findings, including the patterns you noticed, the insights you gleaned from those patterns, and their implications for the design.\n-- Document the analysis in a shareable format.</li>\n</ul>\nDo organizational research. Your work doesn't happen in a vacuum, so interview stakeholders to come up with business requirements. Documentation should include problem statement and assumptions, success metrics, completion criteria, scope, risks/concerns/contingency plans, verbatim quotes (without identifying information), and workflow diagrams. \"...improve the odds that changes will be fully understood and take hold.\"\n\nAssumptions are insults.\n\nHouse M.D. was right: Everybody lies. (But don't break into anyone's house.)\n\nEthnography: getting to know people, generally by talking to them. Interview with an interview guide that has a brief description and goal of the study (share the with the interviewee but also use to keep yourself on track), any demographic questions you'll want to ask, a couple of small talk questions (maybe just for inspiration!), and some questions or topics that are the primary focus. Remember, it's just a guide. When interviewing, you know nothing. The most fascinating thing is the person you are interviewing. Gather a bit of background information (about the subject area, not the person) beforehand.\n\nContextual inquiry: getting to know people by following them around and observing them.\n\nJakob Nielsen's checklist of ten heuristics (heuristic inspection) which can be done by anyone and should be done and scored as often as possible to ensure a basic level of usability. There is more information about these <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/\">here</a>.\n- System status visibility.\n- Match between system and real world.\n- User control and freedom.\n- Consistency and standards.\n- Error prevention.\n- Recognition rather than recall.\n- Flexibility and efficiency of use.\n- Aesthetic and minimalist design.\n- Help users recognize and recover from errors.\n- Help and documentation.\n\nFind out everything you can using cheap usability tests first: paper prototypes before actual ones, tests in the office before tests in the field. It doesn't really matter how often you do usability testing, as long as you do it earlier than right before you launch, when it's expensive to fix things. The most expensive usability testing is the kind your customers do for you by way of customer support.\n\nAsk users to do a task. Have a good facilitator who can put the user at ease but won't lead them through the process. Take notes and record audio; be careful about videotaping because it's trickier. Analyze the data by looking for issues that prevent the user from completing the task or just cause difficulty. Don't forget to note how many users have that issue. At the end, rank the issues in terms of priority and get to work!\n\nHow to do qualitative analysis of your data: review the notes, looking for interesting behaviors, actions, emotions, and verbatim quotes. Write your observations on sticky notes and start to cluster the notes based on patterns. Watch patterns emerge. Rearranging is key. This is an affinity diagram. Use this to name patterns and identify user needs that come from them. The final step is to identify the actionable mandate or principle.\n\nPersonas: fictional archetypes that represent types of users and can be used to \"advocate\" for the user experience. Design, business strategy, marketing, and engineering can benefit from a single set of personas. HOWEVER, design targets ARE NOT marketing targets. The user type with the highest value to the business might be be the one most valuable to the design process. Personas should be fictional, drawing on many different users, but archetypal. Use a photo of a person no one knows. Give them a name, role, goals, demographic, quote, behaviors and habits, skills, environment, relationships, scenarios.\n\nMental models describe how users understand how things work. Strictly speaking there are also the mental models that designers sketch out to create a better world. You can make mental models through user interviews and affinity diagrams. Similarly you can make task/workflow analyses.\n\nQuantitative analysis: split testing! It has math, which makes it more fun, but make sure you know what you're looking for (set up your experiment and define you requirements and goals) and be careful about finding a local maximum-you can only do so much through incremental changes-and upsetting what is working for current users.\n\nConclusion: I'm just going to quote some lines from the conclusion of the book! To inspire!\n\n\"Questions are more powerful than answers. And asking often takes more courage than sticking with comfortable assumptions.\"\n\n\"Cultivate a desire to be proven wrong as quickly as possible and for the lowest cost. If you work in a culture that prizes failing fast, there is no faster way to fail than by testing an idea that's still on the drawing board. Exception maybe checking your assumptions before you even get to drawing.\"\n\n\"Let curiosity be your guide.\"\n\n<hr />\n\nAaaaand we're done. Thanks Erika Hall!",

                    "notes": "This book is about how to market high-tech, disruptive products to mainstream customers. The concept is that early on you're selling your product to the lunatic fringe or early adopters/visionaries, who want something new and exciting that'll get them ahead and don't care if\u00a0it doesn't work perfectly. In fact that's kind of a plus, it's a sign that they're truly ahead of the curve. But eventually you want to sell your product to regular people, pragmatists and conservatives, and they want it to work perfectly every time and for everyone else to be using it also. They want the opposite of what the early people want. So how do you cross the chasm?\n\nThe book was good, strong at the beginning with a bit of a lull and then a good mid-section that got meaty with advice, real world examples, and details that warranted a whole book and not just an article. His theory for how to cross the chasm is to pick a small market segment to dominate, then branch out into others. You need to dominate a market to demonstrate that you're a mainstream solution and not some crazy concept.\n\nA market segment is a group of people with a particular need that all reference each other. To dominate it you need to provide a whole product solution, which generally requires partners, and indicate two competitors: the old guard solution that you're disrupting and another solution comparable to yours that isn't right for this particular application. This is important for the market to accept your product as mainstream, even if it's not yet.\n\nAlthough the book was written specifically for high-tech, disruptive products, a lot of it was more broadly information (how to define a market segment, why whole product solutions are important) and could probably be applied to other kinds of products.\n\nThere was also a little point towards the end about how being an early employee at a start-up never provides good financial compensation, which is the second time of late I've read that. So that was a fun personal touch.",

                    "notes": "Silas' roommate Sarah recommended this book to me. I read it to prepare for interviewing people about jewelry and electronic accessories like activity trackers, watches. I thought it was not as good as Just Enough Research -- it was a little less mean and lean. It also mostly spoke to a circumstance I don't expect to be in: interviewing users in their homes that have been recruited by a recruiting agency. In my case, I expect to interview friends and acquaintances, probably in coffee shops. But it was still a good, fast read that gave me some insight on how to interview users.\n\nIt helped me think more broadly about the kinds of questions I should ask, how to get a larger sense of users' interactions with the world. It confirmed my sense that being quiet is important, as is attentiveness, trying to turn up 'blank' and unassuming, and preparing for the interview with a guide or set up of questions. It also makes me think I should record my interviews, since taking detailed notes is disruptive and often things becomes clearer the second time they are heard. I wish he had spoken a bit more about analyzing interviews, though I understand that wasn't what the book was about. He touches on it briefly but basically says you should read another book about that.\n\nIt reminded me that my experience interviewing my fellow yoga teacher trainees was a good practice in interviewing that will probably help with this different kind of interviewing I'm interested in now.",

Maybe.\n\nIt reads mostly as a series of opinions, which is fine, the author seems to know what he's talking about. He\u00a0also seems interested in reading and writing the kinds of essays I'm interested in, ones in which the author does serious thinking around some problem or event, generally a personal one. The chapters are fairly scattered with no real logical progression that I could gather. It's a scattershot of thoughts about things like how to end an essay and how to ethically write about\u00a0people in your lives.\n\nThere is a second section in which he discusses various famous essayists, which I enjoyed and gave me a good sense of classics I should be reading. He talked about Hazlitt, Lamb, Emerson, Baldwin and Hoagland. He also at various points in the first section attributes the birth of the personal essay to Montaigne.\n\nI think the main thing I remember him talking about which I want to do better is giving the reader a sense of the author's profile at the beginning of the essay. He says the reader needs to know some basic things about you - age, location, gender, demographic, race - in order to understand your personal essay since it's about you. He says it can be hard to include these things elegantly, but it's important. I agree.\n\nOverall not exactly the book I was looking for but an easy and enjoyable read.",

I wasn't sure exactly how I wanted to do this, so I've been doing a combination of reading books, flipping through textbooks, taking online courses (most of which I don't like and don't finish, but that's a different story,) and researching explanations on Wikipedia. This is the first book I finished as part of this endeavor.\n\nI like it's style, but I found the content to be a little lateral to what I was looking for. It's from the sixties and also (obviously) focused more on probability than statistics, though the two are strongly related.\n\nI enjoyed the mix of narrative and technical explanation. Weaver doesn't shy away from equations and uses standard notation for referring back to previous ones. He wrote it for precocious high schoolers and I think fairly accurately judged that level: as someone with an undergraduate education I found the math straightforward. Which is not to say it was unnecessary; I was extremely glad he got detailed with the math and was explicit about when he was not explaining a proof because it was too complicated or detailed or, and generally this was in combination with the previous, not particularly necessary.\n\nThe narrative was useful in tying the theory to its history and uses. However this is where the book was a little astray for me. Weaver talks mostly about counting probabilities, a lot of which came from gambling games. While I found it interesting, it definitely was not the kind of statistics I was looking for. He didn't connect it to experimental design and hypothesis testing at all. It's really a different side of statistics that I didn't realize wasn't, at least in this book, entirely related.\n\nStill, I enjoyed the book and its contents and especially its style.",

I guess you can't get everything.\n\nSalsburg is explicit that this book is made for those with little to no mathematical background, thus it has no equations and not even a good deal of explanation of the mathematics being developed. This was the major flaw in the book for me. I loved his detailed history of the various people developing statistics. He starts with Laplace and Bayes who laid the groundwork for this kind of thinking and then gets deep in Pearson, Fisher, Neyman, and many others who really developed the tools we use today in scientific experimentation. He talks about experiment design and hypothesis testing, the various lemmas and theorems as they were developed to deal with understanding agricultural and epidemiological and beer brewing success.\n\nBut he shies away from anything too mathematical, which was difficult for me because I didn't know about many of the ideas these people were developing and thus gained no insight into the concepts except the high level explanations Salsburg thought were\u00a0appropriate. I think I'd rather have read the book after having a more technical understanding of some of the material, such that the information in the book could have consolidated my learning instead of starting it.\n\nStill, my main takeaway is that statistics led us to think more clearly about how to design and interpret experiments in fields where it is hard to isolate variables: agriculture, medicine, eventually molecular biology, and many others. A lot of this had to do with moving away from considering specific measurements and instead considering the distribution of the those measurement. It also led to a flourishing field of mathematics that dealt with many of the real world problems of experimentation.",

This probably had something to do with his style or tone which simply did not jive with me, unlike Philip Lopate's which, though\u00a0I thought a lot of what he had to say was a bit silly, at least had more ethos to me. However I stuck it out and came to respect Dinty. Throughout the book he applies the lessons he is trying to teach to a sample essay of his. This felt a little contrived but the final essay, which he reveals at the end, is actually very good.\n\nThis book contains a lot of prompts, which I mostly ignored, and a couple sample essays, which I read.\n\nHis advice seems solid. He talked less about the expository nature than Philip did, more about retaining your reader's interest and different styles of essays (lyrical, spiritual, humorous, etc.) However, he too thinks that most personal essays require the writer to be dealing with his thoughts and conflicts; he refers to this as 'chasing mental rabbits'. In many ways the book is probably more useful to help people who aren't sure what to write about, though he also gives a couple pithy case studies in students who have topics but refuse to include conflict or some other driving force.\n\nIt was a quick read and worth it,\u00a0even if just to get a sense of what one of the best-selling books of this nature has to say. I'm not sure I'll be reading more of these, though. Instead I will read some classic personal essays and try to tease them apart for guidance.\n\n&nbsp;",

And Andrew is funny, with a good blend of story and instruction on what the hell statistics is about and how the most common techniques are applied. Even though it's very basic, for instance he never goes into how to calculate a p-value, the conceptual and intuitive explanations for simple techniques was incredibly useful. Even the very beginning, looking at the differences between mean/standard deviations and median/quartiles was interesting.\n\nMajor things I remember: it doesn't make sense to calculate multiple p-values for a single experiment and definitely never compare them. p-values is an indication of the likelihood that your null hypothesis is true, so calculating more than one implies you're testing more than one null hypothesis. In addition, you just can't compare them. I doesn't make any sense. Also, p-values can be skewed by sample size, so make sure you understand your data before calculating\u00a0a p-value otherwise it might give you a deceptive result.\n\nHe got a little more technical towards the end, but not as much as I'd like. He started talking about Wilcoxon values and ANOVA but didn't really go into what they were. I think it would have been better if he got more technical as the book went on, where at the end the level was maybe college math. That way people could bow out of the book when the math got too involved, or continue reading but\u00a0skip the mathematical explanations.\n\nStill, a fun and easy read and probably one everyone should be reading in high school to ensure everyone is statistically literate.",

Dune is a classic science fiction novel that builds a highly intricate world, filled with history and politics and religion, as well as having a story about specific people in a particular place. It's set on the desert planet Dune where they make spice, an expensive drug sought after by everyone in the universe.\n\nIt fascinated me.\n<p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1459725057041_323\">I am not into science fiction or fantasy. I've read some here and there and enjoyed it, but for fiction I tend to stick to that section called literary, or the part of the bookstore that doesn't give any extra adjectives to the novel genre. These stories are about people, not me yet I can see a 'me' in them, not in my world yet in a world I could theoretically know. I have read fiction with intricate plots set in places I do not know; by the nature of being real places they have a complex history and set of politics and religion and this can even play into the characters and plot. But they are not the same. Dune strikes me as fundamentally different that these other stories. I'm not sure why.</p>\nDune's characters struck me as alien.\u00a0It's not that they are not relatable but that the emotional layer of the story is one or two deep. To pick up on it I had to understand the plot points, which were complicated and subtle. There were few emotional scenes, instead the emotional nature of the characters had to be inferred from the actions. But that first layer, of complex and subtle plot points, was so deep as to be practically impenetrable from my single reading. This is echoed by people who have read it multiple times: it takes many readings to reach a level of understanding such that you stop finding new, relevant details.\n\nPerhaps, then, I loved Dune as puzzle. It evokes the best kind of learning experience: putting the understanding of the world just out my reach, fascinating enough that I keep coming back but not so clear that I fully get it.\u00a0I must reach further, think harder, ask questions, re-read. Yet it is the 'fascinating enough' part that is key to that theory. What makes Dune so fascinating that I'm willing to work for it?\n\nDune touches on everything. It delves into political organization, religious groups, the power of leaders, ecological concerns, drugs, the place of love in politics and leadership, the potential of humans to evolve, guerrilla warfare, human survival in terrible living conditions. The list goes on, depending on how you want to slice it. Frank Herbert took all these ideas he wanted to explore, wrapped them up into a novel, and tied it with a bow of a plot that comes to a natural end. It's not that he resolves everything (he doesn't, there are five sequels,) but rather that almost everything <em>can</em> slot into place, even if as the reader I don't exactly know how.\n\nReal life is not so wonderfully clean. The way complex concepts are explored through the progression of the real world probably can never be so succinctly threaded together and understood. In the real world there are loose ends, or if you do believe that all ends are tied, it is at least well-acknowledged that we rarely get to see them tied ourselves. Literary fiction often hinges on this very fundamental aspect of being human: not everything is understood. Characters are not understood by others or do not understand their own actions. Trajectories of events, communities, and movements are haphazard and we often see only a small sliver of it. In comparison, a bird's eye view of Dune is, if not attainable, then not far off.\n\nThe lack of clarity in the real world doesn't simply imply lack of facts.\u00a0There is also no unbiased view through which to understand the facts we do have. For all of its complexity, Dune is crystal clear. Herbert's narration is omniscient but also detached and because he created this world he gets to define the neutral point. If Herbert attempts to teach us things, and I think he does, it is by the consequences of the actions of the characters, not by the way in which the characters or actions are described.\n\nTo dive into a world as complex as our own but so well understood is thrilling. Humans have evolved to seek understanding; building mental models that enable us to interact well with the world is how we thrive. The real world doesn't allow us to have any kind of \"true\" working model, at least I don't think so, but reading a book about an alternate world gets us to a pseudo-complete state.\n\nI think it tickles a very basic part of my brain. I strive to understand the details in a way that no literary novel has ever enticed me. Which is not to say I have not been knee-deep in thoughts about literary novels. They are simply radically different kinds of thoughts, more often than not they are overwhelming emotions. As I said earlier Dune was not, for me, an emotional book at all. It continues to be a puzzle that populates me.\u00a0I plan to read more.",

                    "notes": "This book is amazing. Schulz takes us into the anatomy of being wrong with a great blend of philosophical and experiential explanations of what it even means. She has great insights, like how we rarely are <em>currently</em>\u00a0wrong but rather can only acknowledge being wrong in the past--to be wrong in the present would mean to not believe what we believe in, which is paradoxical. She talks about the evolutionary theory of not wanting to be wrong, of how humans create great models of the world that work most of the time, of why that's what makes us so good at being in the world. She ties this to Thomas Kuhn's theory of scientific revolutions: that people, too, need far more evidence to recant a theory than to create one. She touches on optical illusions, relationship failures, conversion stories and finally, at the end, the upside of being wrong: art, imagination, scientific discovery.\n\nI will say that the first half of the book was tighter, where each chapter built upon the last. Towards the end it got a little hectic as subjects did not relate to each other so clearly.\n\nWhich is not to say it wasn't great. I genuinely think about my mindset more. Tied to all of Fogg's work around political reconsidering, it fits right in as a conceptual tool for understanding my own thoughts about the world. As Schulz says, it's easy to recognize the irrationality of others' beliefs but incredibly hard to recognize this in ourselves.",

Or just a very strange man called Bill. It's a bit about manic depression, and climate change, and being a parent.\n\nIt's a wonderful read.\n\nAt book club we talked a lot about Bill -- Hope's friend, counterpart, and constant companion. Did we know a 'Bill'? Many of us did. We all seemed to like and respect 'Bill's, but none of us were one, we think. For me, the phrase of the book that best described Hope's relationship with Bill was fraternal twin. Someone who you're connected to in an incredibly deep manner, deep as in low-level, subconscious, pre-sexual.\n\nThe parts of the book about plants were wonderful almost-scientific reads, beautiful in a way that made me want to study plants. (Though I get that kind of adoration about almost anything presented to me.) Those parts were written poetically, with emphasis on the visual and the sensual and the metaphorical. They were analogies for the chapter to follow. A hint, or a fun story-with-larger-moral.\n\nSo much of the book is about struggle, yet Hope is wildly successful, winning awards and grants and obviously a book deal. It's interesting that the successes she focuses on are small: getting Bill a reliable salary, getting a lab of her own, getting through her pregnancy. Perhaps the other ones are secondary.",

It seems to take place in a similar world to Minority Report, with precogs and people who can read minds, but there are also inertials-- people who can cancel out other people's psychic abilities.\n\nI don't really want to write about the specifics, because they're great and unusual and should be read. But to jog my memory for a later, a bunch of inertials from a prudence company are sent to the moon for a mission, which is actually a trap where a bomb goes off in an attempt to kill them. The rest of the book is them trying to figure out why the world is behaving so strangely.\n\nWhat I really enjoyed about the book is twofold. The primary twist of 'what is going on here?' is considered early on but partially rejected and partially just not dealt with by the main characters. The fact that as a reader I could have said, 'Oh yeah, duh, of course that's what's going in,' but didn't put me right in the shoes of the characters. At end, when the twist becomes clear, it becomes incredibly obvious. But only because you knew what was going on. This might seem obvious, but again I was in the same position as the characters, who also <em>could not have known</em> what was going on. Without giving it away, neither I nor the characters could have known, because neither of us knew enough about the world of the book. I liked this. Unlike a detective story, you can't know the ending based on clues.\n\nI will say though that the last chapter was unnecessary and I recommend ignoring it. I think Philip is just throwing us for a spin because he can. It didn't seem to actually fit with the rest of the well-devised story.",

He focuses mainly on the hard things; the subtitle of the book is \"Building a business when there are no easy answers.\" He now runs a venture capitalist business.\n\nI thought his story of running a software company through the dot-com bust and coming out on the other side with\u00a0a successful sale to HP was gripping; I read the first half of the book the night after I picked it up from the library. But\u00a0it was his advice throughout the rest of the book that really struck me. It shed a lot of light on what the previous company I worked for did wrong. My last months at that company were anxiety inducing to the point where\u00a0I dreaded going to work. Yet it was my first job; I couldn't figure out exactly what was going so very wrong.\n\nHere is one thing\u00a0Ben articulated that really resonated with me:\n\nIn 'CEOs Should Tell It Like It Is': \"My single biggest personal improvement as CEO occurred on the day I stopped being too positive. ... As the highest-ranking person in the company, I thought that I would be best able to handle bad news. The opposite was true: Nobody took bad news harder than I did.\" He lists three key reasons why being transparent about your company's problems makes sense: \u00a01) Trust.\u00a02) The more brains working on the hard problems, the better.\u00a03) A good culture is like the old RIP routing protocol: Bad news travels fast; good news travels slow.\n\nHe talks about a lot of other great, fascinating things as well. Like how setting timelines and guidelines for promotions and raises decreases the amount of politics in a company instead of increasing it-- this way employees don't get these things out of cycle, which always trickles back to others thinking that the best way to get ahead is to go bug someone higher up the chain. Or how CEOs have to take the lonely position of making final decisions often without anyone else's help. Sure, a CEO can and should get information from others, but the CEO should know far more than every single person she gets information from. She is, therefore, the only one who can truly make an informed decision. Or how there is a difference between a wartime CEO and a peacetime CEO.\n\nIn addition, Ben is a great writer. He's long when it's story driven and short when it's advice driven. He's direct, honest, and every word of the book makes me think he's a good guy, even when he talks about telling people off or\u00a0firing\u00a0employees.",

Then two of his books turned up on someone's reading list, so I figured I'd give them a shot.\n\nPurple Cow is mostly about how you need to build remarkable\u00a0products that appeal\u00a0to specific people, as opposed to building bland products that you need to figure out how to mass market. This concept isn't super deep but neither is the book super long. However he does dig into a little more than a couple sentences can describe. He makes an argument for the rise and fall of TV marketing and the requirement for successful organizations to constantly innovate. He does short case studies. Actually, every section of the book is super short. He gave the book away for free. It was an easy, engaging read. He's a good writer with a lot of ideas.",

                    "notes": "This is going to give away some ending details, so ye be warned.\n\nI liked this book, but I was disappointed with the portrayal of women. Yes, one of the male characters in OASIS (the virtual world everyone prefers to the real), the protagonist's best friend, turns out to be a heavyset African American queer girl, and the protagonist is fine with it. Cool. We'll get into that later. But the only other female character, save for a friendly little old lady, is exactly what I expect a teenager boy to dream up.\n\nArt3mis (the girl) is into everything\u00a0Parzival (the protagonist) is\u00a0into. Art3mis, though she doesn't portray herself as a supermodel, is voluptuous and attractive. She's about as smart as Parzival, maybe a bit smarter. Her main flaw (or feature, unclear,) is that she really wants to win the game before dating Parzival. And that she wants to meet him in person. The entirety of the depth of her character is that she has a port-wine stain on her face that she's is worried will make Parzival not like her. (Don't worry, he does.) Wow. Deep.\n\nErnest Cline makes everything easy for Parzival. Parzival doesn't have to deal romantically with his\u00a0suddenly female best friend because she's gay. (In fact, Aech's real-life character gets about a page and a half of limelight, and it's all a quick explanation and acceptance and we're done.) He doesn't have to deal with any problems with his crush other than winning the game. His crush magically likes him a lot. And the book doesn't have to deal with women at all, really. With maybe twenty named characters, only the two are female.\n\nAnd it's unclear if Aech even counts as a female as she's treated as a male character the entire time and no, I don't count that as progressive. Aech doesn't get the opportunity to ever be female, I don't care if she actually is. She doesn't get the time or character development that would allow her to be a queer, African American woman forced to live in a world where she is only accepted as a white, straight guy. She's gets a page and a half of explanation and then she's Aech again, as if nothing had ever happened. How does Art3mis feel about Aech being female? How does Shoto or Ogden Morrow?\n\nThe more I think about it, the madder I get. Ernest Cline seemed close to wanting to try to deal with female characters. He wanted his female character (Art3mis) to be cool and powerful and snarky, so he\u00a0did that but in process made her a cookie-cutter of what his main character was looking for. (Here's a question that's never brought up: is Parzival what Art3mis is looking for?) He wanted to talk about how virtual reality might effect minorities so he made Aech who she is, but then didn't unpack it all. For him, that's not important. What's important is that his white, straight, male main character gets to have a lot of fun. Hm.",

And then I searched 'What's the ending of Infinite Jest' again and read some people's ideas and realized that I didn't care too much about the plot ending, the various parallel lines that are meant to converge just past the frame. What I really cared about was the plot that did exist, the parts inside the frame, which themselves are so tightly wound and intricate that I had plenty to chew on without bothering about the speculation.\n\nThe book is amazing, much better the second time around though both times I got to a point in which it engulfed me. I struggle to be engulfed in long books in the same way a normal-sized novel can really pull me in, the length is so daunting that the writing has to really show up to make me get over the fact that I realistically cannot rush-read the whole thing. Wallace does this, with only a few sections that tired me out and a single section that I'll admit I skipped.

I did.\n\nI like his candid questioning of the reader of animal rights in 'Consider the Lobster'.\n\nI like his distraction, almost to a fault, in 'Up, Simba' (about the 2000 McCain primaries campaign.)\n\nI had already read 'Authority and American Usage' and again liked his obsession with fiddling out why a dictionary could be great.\n\nI liked the strange disappointment in professional athletes in 'How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart'.\n\nI disliked the way the footnotes were arranged in 'Host' and wasn't sure I really understood much more about right-wing talk shows at the end, though it was classically entertaining to read him intellectually futzing around with some theories about their success.\n\n'The View from Mrs. Thompson's' was a touchingly hilarious account of 9/11.\n\n(Essays I didn't mention: 'Big Red Son' about the porn industry Oscar equivalent, 'Certainly the End of Something or Other' about Updike's book that Wallace didn't like, 'Some Remarks on Kafka's Funniness' of which the topic is obvious, and 'Joseph Frank's Dostoevsky' which is about Joseph Frank's books about Dostoevsky.)\n\nI will say I ended the book with less unadulterated love of David Foster Wallace, not because it's bad but because it demonstrated in several places his humanity and ability to write silly thoughts and be neurotic to the point where it isn't helping anyone. I think what draws me to him is his amazing portrayal of similar neurotic and cynical thoughts to those that I have -- it's like someone saying \"oh, yeah, I do this crazy thing in my head all the time\" and I respond with \"holy shit me too.\"",

The last Jeanette Winterson book I read (probably about a year ago) was Sexing the Cherry, and comparatively Weight is an easy and straightforward book. Weight is one of those books that feels like the language is so simple that it cannot be special, though as the story continues it becomes clear the amount of control Winterson has over her language and what felt simple was actually just sparse -- it's all she needs.\n\nMy favorite part is towards the end when Atlas becomes friends with Laike, the Russian dog sent into space. It is a tender, absurd moment, because all the other Greek gods have become forgotten and disappeared, but Atlas continues to hold up the earth and learn of people's troubles.\n\nAnother part that struck me was the scene of Atlas, having given the world to Heracules to hold while he does Heracules a favor, walks onto (into?) earth from his place of holding up the entire universe. How he just almost waltzes down from the clouds and then becomes somewhat human sized on earth. Again, the control of language here for the moment to feel natural is amazing.\n\nOf course the story is about weight: the weight of the stories of our lives, of our anxieties and truths and directions and decisions and ultimately about how that weight is both something we must shoulder and can also let go, that those are things that don't necessarily require carrying.",

Each chapter is a series of short vignettes about cities, bookended with a description of the scenes between emperor Kublai Khan and explorer Marco Polo. The cities are all conceptual, like a city that is built in the air, hanging between two mountain peaks, or a city which is designed based on the experience of chasing someone through a city but never catching them. They're little ideas about life: a city that decrepit and disgusting but has momentary shines of beauty, or a city that attempts to exterminate all the bugs only to make room for imaginary creatures.\n\nIn the conversations between Kublai Khan and Marco Polo, some of which are imagined conversations, it becomes apparent that Marco Polo is describing the same city over and over again, picking out a piece of it to explore each time.\n\nI read the book shortly after Trump won the 2016 USA presidential election.

I thought it would be primarily about Transcendental Meditation. I knew of David Lynch's films but I had never seen anyway. Shortly after starting the book it became clear that it was mostly about David Lynch as a person, for people who love his movies and want to understand their creator. Having never seen him movies, this made the book feel little sparse. I didn't particularly enjoy the writing style and his commentary felt empty to me.\n\nI also didn't like how he tried to justify his experiences with meditation by saying physicists had discovered the Unified Theory and therefore science was catching up to meditation. This just makes no sense to me. A unified theory is just a theory of fundamental forces in the universe, plus we have yet to agree on one, and a theory is just a posit of how the world might work, so I don't understand what that has to do with humans being able to control their mental state.\n\nGiven all this it wasn't a bad read. I like the metaphor of having to go into deep waters to catch big fish (in which the fish are your artist ideas). Shortly after finishing it I watched Blue Velvet, one of Lynch's movies, which I found incredibly disturbing, though also very good.",

I was apolitical and the election of Obama made that an easy stance to keep. However, with the election of Trump I suddenly feel like politics are something I need to pay attention to. So I've been reading.\n\nI don't think Listen, Liberal is an amazing book, (it's been rightly called polemic, as opposed to informative,) but for someone with a poor grasp on recent US history I found it helpful. Frank's basic tenant is that the Democrats have lost their interest in the working class and replaced it with an interest in the professional class. This means their policy decisions tend to be bad for the working class. There are a couple of interesting ideas within this framework: Professionals, especially\u00a0those coming from a working class background, think that the best way to improve the plight of the working class is to give them more education, i.e. that way they can become professionals. Wall Street is filled with professionals, so courting professionals is essentially courting Wall Street.\n\nIt was a great reminder of all the shit Bill Clinton did which I would not consider liberal or progressive at all: repealing the Glass-Steagall Act, enacting 'three strikes' prison laws, repealing welfare programs.\n\nWhat frustrated me about this book is that Frank complains and complains about the policy and ideology of the Democrats but never gives much sense of what would be better. When he complains that the Democrats haven't brought jobs back to the working class, my immediate question is 'How can we do that?' and he doesn't even bother to try. I don't think he ever intended it to be a book that dialogued with policy. He just wants to point out flaws in the Democrats, which he does well. Definitely not the end of my edification.",

                    "notes": "The Unwinding was an undertaking. I requested it from the library shortly after Trump won on Nov 8th; it was recommended reading by some left-wing news site for understanding what is going on in this country. Then it sat on my desk for a week or two while I finished up Future Sex. I didn't really know what to expect. It was one of those books I requested on a whim, by some random recommendation, and generally it's 50/50 whether or not I actually like it. I knew it was nonfiction and about the United States.\n\nWhen I got to it I was immediately struck by how literary it was. The Unwinding is really a series of stories of people. Some of the people are regular people who we keep going back to, starting with their family history from before WWI and following them through childhood in the mid-1900s and seeing them grow up and into 2015. Some of the people are famous, they get these one chapter character sketches that try to set them in time and cultural trends. The book is chronological, sections representing years, but it does not feel like a history book or even a political book. It feels like a postmodern novel.\n\nPacker follows a woman growing up in ruined old industrial\u00a0towns and a man from an old farming family, a southern man who goes on to work for Biden in the White House and then a lobbying firm and then back to Congress, many more people from various parts of the country and livelihoods, Packer looks at towns where the steel mills closed, at the housing bubble developing in Tampa, at Occupy Wall Street. It's a harrowing look at the country -- it's called 'The Unwinding' after all -- but it's also incredibly personal and real.\n\nAlmost every chapter I came out angry, aware, uncertain: I didn't really understand the housing bubble, I didn't really understand Obama, I didn't really understand steel mills or farming but I got a little bit closer. It struck me that very few people seemed like bad people (perhaps the only exception is Newt Gringrich!) and yet the country unraveled anyway. Still I found glimmers of optimism: the community organizer from Youngstown, Ohio trying to make the city right again after the steel mills left, the rural south entrepreneur championing biofuel, the Washington aide trying to put bankers in jail. There are so many people in the country trying to be the best they can be and do the best they can do. I have to believe we have what it takes.",

I've decided it's when you want to write a novel but it ends up just being about your life.\n\nMy Struggle\u00a0starts with Knausgaard musing about death in perhaps current times. He also muses about raising his children. But we quickly cut back to an experience of his as a young child that focuses a lot on his tense relationship with his father. The majority of the book ends up being about his experience as a teenager and again his father features heavily, often as a background figure. Towards the end of the book, Knuasgaard mostly relives the experience of his father dying when he is in adulthood.\n\nKnausgaard is a master of weaving together his memories, going into a memory from a memory, often pages long, and then coming back out again, like coming up for air. It's strangely addicting, though the book has no strong narrative arc to speak of there is the theme of his father and of coming of age and how those two intertwine. Mostly, though, the book seems to me to be about how our extensive details impact these tiny moments, that these tiny moments in our life cannot be understood without tracking through the past. For instance, in moments he spends with his brother while dealing with their father's death, Knausgaard takes on a whirlwind tour of his relationship with his brother, which despite being 300 pages into the book we have yet to really delve into. This tour then ends by returning on the original scene of a particular moment in dealing with their father's death, that moment now laden with much more meaning.\n\nThe writing is plain, the kind that gets out of the way; it's so good I don't notice it.\n\nI'm intrigued to read more of the books, mostly to see what he does with them.

I did not find it too depressing.\n\nThis book was written in 1937, before Bernays was as famous as he is today, though he was plenty famous at the time. The introduction, by Stuart Ewen, is fascinating in itself. Ewen met Bernays shortly before Bernays died. Bernays brainstorms with Ewen how he would make a book Ewen had recently written become a success; Ewen thinks perhaps Bernays put in a good word for his book as events played out similar to how Bernays envisioned them, though he has never been sure. Ewen also comments on how Bernays' wife did much of Bernays work, though Bernays admits to never attributing it to her because it was unthinkable\u00a0at the time that a woman could do such good work.\n\nBernays has the idea the public need to be guided from above, that the government is responsible for swaying public opinion. He oscillates between respect and disrespect for the average person. On one hand, they are to trotted along, on the other, they are complex and individual and this needs to be appreciated (in order to trot them along.)\n\nPlenty of the book is examples of how public opinion was changed. Bernays was responsible for allowing women to smoke -- a sign of freedom and equality, although in fact he was trying to improve tobacco sales. He came up with the idea of improving the sales of bacon by having newspapers report on how physicians believed a heavier breakfast was good for the health. His ideas are all incredibly simple and yet amazing inventive and powerful. Much of it has to do with pulling in third parties or tangential ideas. A hotel is grappling with a rumor that it is shutting down, so he suggests publicly renewing the contract of a well-respected, leading employee.\n\nA lot of it revolves on how to best use newspapers and the importance of the newspaper as a tool. I suspect much of that has changed now that there are so many more options for newspaper, that they are figuring out a new business model, and there are many more options for news outside of newspapers. Bernays had it easier. Though I suspect he would find trolls genius.\n\nSome quotes I took down:\n\n\"If we look back upon the developments of some such thing as the steam engine, we cannot fail to be struck by the extreme obviousness of each advance, and how obstinately it was refused a assimilation until the machine almost invented itself.\"\n\n\"All papers feature big news. When there is no big news, real editing is needed to select the real news from the semi news. What you read on dull news days is what fixes your opinion of your country and of your compatriots. <strong>It is from the non-sensational news that you see the world and assess, rightly or wrongly, the true value of persons and events.</strong>\"\n\n\"Propaganda is a purposeful, directed effort to overcome censorship \u2013 the censorship of the group mind and the herd reaction. <strong>The average citizen is the world's most efficient censor.

In the introduction she recounts the various polarizing responses from the academic and medical community to her research, which also investigated the medicalization of female sexuality via the medical \"condition\" hysteria. One of my favorites is how IEEE thought her article on the vibrator was a joke:\n\n<a href=\"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=31556\">Socially Camouflaged Technologies: The Case of the Electromechanical Vibrator</a>, Rachel Maines, 'Technology and Society', IEEE 1989\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">\"The Technical Advisory Board (TAB) of IEEE was threatening to withdraw the publication charter of 'Technology and Society' on the grounds that since there couldn't possibly be anyone named Rachel Maines who had actually written this article, it must be some sort of elaborate practical joke on the part of the co-editors. ... As one TAB member expressed it, 'It read like a parody of an IEEE article. It contained dozens and dozens of obsolete references.'\"</p>\nThe book, too, is fairly academic. However, I was hoping the focus would be more on the vibrator itself. Instead, about half the book is about hysteria and the medical literature around it. To be fair, this is fascinating, the way that society was so invested in the androcentric view of sexuality that sexual intercourse was essentially the only \"real\" sexual act, which produced problems for women given that they rarely achieve orgasm through intercourse alone. In various studies, even in the early 1900s, when most women (generally some 60% or more) did not orgasm through intercourse, those women were removed from the study given that they were outside the norm. Never mind the fact that 60% is clearly a majority. But this had been the Western tradition since Aristotle: women did not enjoy penetration that much, which meant there was something wrong with them, not something wrong with the sexual act.\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">\"Ninetheenth-century physicians noted that their hysterical and neurasthenic women patients experienced traditional androcentric intercourse mainly as a disappointment.\"</p>\nEarlier, though, physicians would treat hysteria, which was a kind of catch-all disease for women being sexual or rowdy, with massage of the genitals. This was not something the physicians liked to do because it was difficult and tiresome, though it was also extremely profitable as these women often were never fully \"cured\" but required repeated treatment.\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">\"Since no penetration was involved, believers in the hypothesis that only penetration was sexually gratifying to women could argue that nothing sexual could be occurring when their patients experienced the hysterical paroxysm during treatment.\"</p>\nThe invention of the vibrator not only was generally more effective (and faster) than manual massage, it eased the labor on the physicians. The problem was when they became small and cheap enough to be sold to women directly. In the 1920s vibrators made it to the porn scene and soon hysteria would become an obsolete medical invention.\n\nHowever, we're still dealing with the repercussions of centuries of belief that women must also find the peak or best or only real\u00a0sexual act to be penetration. Given that it is the center of conception, and that we still don't understand the biological underpinnings of female orgasm, I can appreciate the confusion. However, the data simply does not pan out: in every case in history, most women did not achieve orgasm through penetration alone.\n\nStill, I wanted the book to get a little more detailed on the mechanics of the various vibrator inventions. But maybe what I need is a book on the vibrator written by an engineer, not a historian.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

                    "notes": "This series of essays is cobbled together from a number of projects Zadie Smith has done. They are loosely grouped into themes, the themes loosely group into a book, but more I found it just a dipping into Zadie Smith's mind, which is my favorite thing about essays. She writes about an Oxfam trip to Liberia, about movies, about Middlemarch and Kafka and E. M. Forster, about Barthes v Nabokov, about Zora Neale Hurston, on Hepburn and the Oscars and her father and David Foster Wallace.\n\nThe stories about her father, especially on how her interviewing of her father about WWII was so clearly about her and not him, how she used his stories in White Teeth, to learn more about Zadie Smith's history and see how it trickled into her writing was interesting and rewarding from a writer's perspective. I want to dig into some of these essays again, the personal ones, to learn a little more about the craft of those essays.\n\nI also want to reread her essay on Wallace, who I love, such that I can better articulate what I love about him. First, though, I think I need to read <em>Brief Interviews</em>, the Wallace book of short stories she talks about.\n\nOverall a good read with some essays I want to return to.",

                    "notes": "I read this book at the suggestion of two different computer science professors as I went through my grad school visits. It's from 1980 and is a linguistics/philosophy book. It claims that metaphors are not just the poetic devices we hear in Shakespeare's sonnets, but rather our primary tool for understanding and sometimes even defining abstract concepts.\n\nThe primary example used throughout the book is the metaphor ARGUMENT IS WAR.\u00a0Think of\u00a0how we talk about arguments: 'He defended his point.' 'I attacked his position.' 'She held her ground.' It is hard to think of how we talk about argument that <em>doesn't</em> use the language of war. But it is not true that this is the only metaphor a language or culture could use. Perhaps another metaphor could be ARGUMENT IS DANCE or ARGUMENT IS EXERCISE.\u00a0These metaphors would change the way we talk about argument, but also change the way we think about argument.\n\nMore examples:\n\nIDEAS ARE PLANTS. Her ideas have come to fruition. She has a fertile imagination.\nIDEAS ARE PEOPLE. He is the father of modern biology. Who's brainchild is that?\nIDEAS ARE FOOD. Those are half-baked ideas. I can't digest all this at once. His idea smells fishy.\nUNDERSTANDING IS SEEING. I see what your saying. I understand your viewpoint. That was a brilliant remark. She's got the whole picture.\nLIFE IS A CONTAINER. She's brimming with life. I've had a full life. There's not much life left in him.\n\nThey break down how metaphors are tools to map disparate concepts onto each other. A metaphor is a partial overlap that highlights some similarities and hides others. If two concepts are too similar, it is not a metaphor but rather a subcategorization. CAT IS PET is not a metaphor, for instance. Poetic metaphors are unusual ones, either ones that are rarely made in society or take a normal metaphor to lesser-known parts of the overlap. Another common metaphor for argument is AN ARGUMENT IS A BUILDING: 'I'm constructing my argument.' 'She laid the foundation for her argument.' 'It's a flimsy argument.' A poet might say: 'Her argument was made of cheap stucco.' This is fundamentally the AN ARGUMENT IS A BUILDING metaphor but takes it to a more precise place of overlap that is uncommon.\n\nLakoff and Johnson are experientialists. They argue this lies somewhere between subjectivity and objectivity, where we create our meaning from physical experiences we have. Our metaphors are all based from experiences we have of gravity (up, down,) our posture (vertical,) our view frame (front, back,) our existence as beings separate from others (containers.) They argue that saying THE CLOUDS ARE IN FRONT OF THE MOUNTAINS requires a huge amount of abstract thought because mountains and clouds are not clearly delineated objects, nor do they have an inherent front/back. Instead we shared assumptions about how clouds and mountains can be contained by boundaries (like us) and have front/back (like us.) Or most basic metaphors are based in these experiences we have. GOOD THINGS ARE UP because being physically healthy raises us above the ground. Then follows HIGH STATUS IS UP and FUTURE IS UP. Again, part of this is cultural, not innate.\n\nThey also touch on categorization and the concept that we create prototypes for categories and certain aspects of those prototypes can be highlighted or hidden. (Look!\u00a0An UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING metaphor.) Similarly metaphors, especially more abstract ones like LOVE IS MADNESS or LOVE IS CREATING A WORK OF ART, highlight and hide certain aspects of the concept.\n\nThe biggest take aways for me were:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Lots of our everyday language is metaphorical and those metaphors frame our definitions for abstract concepts.</li>\n\t<li>Metaphors require partial overlap; too much overlap and it is simply categorization, too little and they don't aid in understanding.</li>\n\t<li>New metaphors are how we understand new concepts or ideas.</li>\n</ul>",

                    "notes": "It wasn't until the very last section of this daunting 700 page novel that I realized that the icons of the bird at the end of some chapters indicated one of the seven killings just occurred. I flipped back through the book, looking for the others to find out what were the seven, iconic killings but I couldn't find them. The book is huge.\n\nMuch of this novel is in voice, like Zadie Smith's White Teeth but moreso because each chapter is explicitly in the voice of a character. Sometimes the Jamaican English tired me\u00a0because although it is clearly English it has a rhythm that was difficult for me to understand. It was more work. Towards the end of the book this Jamaican English is commented upon by an American doctor who asks the Jamaican nurse to translate his English into 'Jamaican' for a patient. The nurse refuses\u00a0to translate because there is nothing to translate. It's English.\n\nThe book lulled for me around the third quarter, as many long books do, but it picked up again at the end. The book is confusing, I couldn't always keep the Jamaican politics straight and could rarely figure out what was going on with the CIA and the Cuban\u00a0anti-Castro involvement. There were plot points I definitely missed or maybe forgot, like what exactly happened to Nina Burgess. But it was a strong, engaging book that sprawled over decades and countries and such terrible, terrifying violence.\n\nI just read the NY Times review and the reviewer compares the book to David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest. This comparison, of a strong book I just read and a crazy intense book I love and have read twice, reminded me of another writer arguing that the American Novel is a farce, that some overly-intellectual white guy's story can never speak for everyone, that no one can every speak for everyone, especially in America. I think my apprehension about comparing Infinite Jest to A Brief History of Seven Killings is more a cultural one: Infinite Jest, though so strange and weird, is so much closer to my experience than Brief History. I know nothing of ghettos or gangs or violence. But this doesn't make Brief History a worse book, though I suspect it may make it harder for\u00a0it to get the acclaim it deserves.",

                    "notes": "I read this book because my friend wrote it and because I was intrigued by the 'stop guessing' admonishment. I do a lot of problem solving, though lately I would call it debugging because it's electrical or software engineering work, and the idea that I may be inadvertently guessing at difficult problems seemed possible.\n\nOf course there are nine behaviors: stop guessing, smell the problem, embrace your ignorance, know what problem you're solving, dig into fundamentals, don't rely on experts, believe in a simple solution, make fact-based decisions, and stay on target. I agree with them all, though the examples come heavily from Greene's experience as a consultant for manufacturing lines. Smelling a firmware problems requires a base level of skill above watching a machine package something, as does digging into the fundamentals. However, I too have been lead astray by not focusing on the problem at hand\u00a0(kind of 'know what problem you're solving' and 'stay on target' rolled into one) and relying too heavily on experts.\n\nAlthough there were some examples of lifestyle problem solving, like lowering your cholesterol or losing weight, it was hard to see how that could truly be successful. For instance, the lowering cholesterol piece relied on the scientific community discovering that cholesterol levels in the body are not tied to the amount of cholesterol you consume. How could I have figured that out?\n\nI've had a nagging hamstring injury for a long time now but it's very intermittent. I kept trying to think how I could apply these behaviors to help me solve this problem but no clear steps came up. I smell the problem by listening closely to my body. I've definitely embraced my ignorance, but I don't have a team of experts on hand to embrace it with. I've done everything, but it's a complex problem with very long feedback loops. Tendons can take months to heal properly and sometimes scar tissue forms. It's hard to know if it has healed properly, hard to know if something I have done has made it better in the long- or short-term.\n\nI found the book to be useful reminders for engineering but pretty hopeless for my injury.",

Chemistry's main character, whose name we never learn, is Chinese, born in Shanghai but brought to the US with her parents at a young age. She questions why she is even doing chemistry--is it just because of her overbearing parents? But the novel is also\u00a0about her relationship with her boyfriend, who she will not commit to. She won't say yes or no to his marriage proposal, she won't say yes or no to moving with him to Oberlin when he gets a faculty job. She doesn't feel like his equal. She can't commit without having career success.\u00a0She doesn't want to have a marriage like her parents had.\n\nIt's a short novel. I read it almost all in one go, from when I picked it up at the library around 6pm to when I almost finished it at 9pm. It's somewhat stream of consciousness, lots of little sections that relate a scene in sparse detail in the first person. But it's also hilarious with this sharp, dark humor of a woman trying to make sense of herself and the world around her. And of course there is the science, all these little science metaphors, all these little explanations of light, of clouds, of thermodynamics. I immediately felt at home in this book that argon boxes and Nobel's first invention, dynamite.\n\nA great joke: What do you do with a sick chemist? Helium. Curium. Barium.",

                    "notes": "I saw Robert read his poetry at Grolier's Poetry Shop in Harvard Square. Maryam invited me and we had been meaning to go to reading together. So though it was a gross, winter's night and biking resulted in spikes of ice shooting into my face, I attended the reading on a Friday evening. It was awkward. Very few people where there; those that were either knew Robert well or knew the Grolier's staff well. I had never heard of him. I stood around awkwardly, browsing the shelves, so awkwardly that the staffed asked if I was there for the reading. I told her I was.\n\nMany of Robert's poems were about death -- the death of his sister during surgery, his brother's suicide, and his father's death. He spoke about each poem before reading it, giving us a context that would be nearly impossible to glean from the book alone. It made the poems feel more alive to understand how intensely personal they were. A little more beautiful.\n\nThe first poem he read was actually a funny one, about the ghosts of famous poets making fun of him for going to the gym. But then we got to the rougher ones: the feeling of his sister's house after she has unexpectedly died; explaining to his son what it means when a ladybug dies; the perspective of the wooden beam from which his brother hung himself. They are rough poems and they feel like eulogy, sometimes, a way to keep his memories alive.\n\nI ended up liking the poems a lot, so I bought the book and took several months to finish it at home. They are not all that good and they seem to lack a theme other than him -- his life, his experiences, the things in his head that come together. I don't especially like that. I wanted a different thread, a different thought of why write poetry other than \"I experience things\" though I suppose Patricia Lockwood's books are not so different. Except she has this incredibly distinctive way of thinking and her poems are rarely about themselves. Robert Fanning felt in some ways bland.\n\nHowever the poems were solid little things and many rang home true. The title is wonderful.",

It's kind of the opposite of My Struggle: My Struggle was an autobiography written as a novel whereas Moonglow is a novel written as an autobiography.

Incredibly hot-headed but also incredibly intelligent. Loyal to the bone. A rough life, a life of getting in trouble, of trying to keep his wife, a Jewess who survived WWII in Europe, together, though her problems span the book. The grandfather is an engineer. He is telling Michael his stories on his deathbed and the stories are never-ending and astounding.\n\nThe book is engaging though I pause about halfway through and end up finishing it on a bus to NYC. It's a great book, but the grandeur of the grandfather bothered me -- is anyone really like that? So interesting, so smart, so much drama?

Here's what I wrote for Boston Hassle about the event:\n<blockquote>Patricia Lockwood is a poet pre-occupied with the strange, often the sexually strange. In the small room next door to the bookstore hosting the reading, she wears a trim pixie haircut, a black dress, and large, black earrings that look suspiciously like the tasseled ends of a curtain draw. In other words: too classy to be a poet who wrote a poem about the world gang-banging a deer, which she manages to reference within ten minutes of the event beginning.\n\nOf course she's not here to read poetry but to talk about her memoir, Priestdaddy. The book recounts her experience living with her parents as an adult, the title referencing the fact that her father is a priest, entering into priesthood with a wife and children through a loophole. She reads a passage in which she converses with a seminarian visiting the house, warning us that her use of a Chicago accent when quoting him has gotten worse and worse as her book tour has gone on. In the passage, we learn that she informs him what it means to be a 'furry' and he is glad to come across this knowledge: in the case anyone ever confesses him about such a thing he needs to know to what they are referring. (If you do not know, I suggest looking it up, though: NSFW.)\n\nAfter she reads the passage, Nina McLaughlin, a local Cambridge author who is also a carpenter and happened to work on my brother's house, interviews her about the book. They talk about who the book is really about, hint, it's Patricia's mother, and how people often comment on the satire of the dialogue of Patricia's parents in the book--that is all real, she affirms, that is the most real part of the whole book. The room is small and intimate, we are all on folding chairs or standing in the corners and the front row is close enough that they could easily lean forward touch Patricia or Nina, and when Nina asks for questions from audience there is that awkward silence of no one knowing what to say. Patricia calmly open a packet of peanut M&amp;Ms she had stashed behind her water. Someone asks if she wants a Red-bull.\n\nThe whole event is strangely conversational, Patricia extraordinarily comfortable talking to us like we are already friends, realizing that she knows people in the audience from Twitter, (she is also well-known for being a Twitter aficionado which you can take as you will,) complimenting an audience member on his podcast about Ethan Hawke (which he started as a project after Trump got elected -- as I said, we all became friends.) At the end most of us line up to get our books signed, which includes Patricia drawing an animal of our choice on the front page, an endeavor that turns out to take so much time I almost regret the hilarity of it all. I get a hedgehog with a tail (nope, hedgehog's don't have tails,) and no nipples. \"I think he's too young for nipples,\" Patricia tells me as I leave, which almost makes sense.</blockquote>\nBut the book, the book. It shines bright with fantastic imagery, almost every sentence a medallion reflecting light off it, creating something new. Her voice startles me, it is intense and weird and I love it and I loved learning a bit about where it came from, a peek into the life that made her who she is.\n\nOf course it is strange and sad and her commentary on religion and her family is ever so kind, though also cutting. I almost don't want to write about but live in it a little longer.\n\nI have a similar feeling towards Patricia Lockwood as I do (or did, before I tried to read Brief Interviews with Hideous Men) towards David Foster Wallace: I desperately want to write like her but know that I cannot because I am not her. I must write like myself. I think I just see a piece of myself in her writing expanded out to great volume.",

But I finally I was buying more paper for my printer and thought, gotta buy this poetry book eventually.\n\nI read it in Buffalo, NY, when I went with Silas on his work trip. I read it in the hotel one day when I stayed there to do a bunch of work.\n\nThe poems are striking and sad, lots of sexual assault and terribleness. I'm not in love with the style, short lines and airy in this way that modern poetry often is, little rhyme or rhythm to hang onto, only stark images spread across the page sparsely. Reminded me a bit of Ocean Vuong, who she thanks in her acknowledgements. But I have yet to fall in love with Vuong's poetry, either, despite all the buzz.\n\nIt was a definitely a set of poems about her, a little window into her world and soul through the lens of her poetic voice. Reminds me of the Mike Birbiglia quote about not liking a comedian: It's just that I don't like *you*. You know, your personality. If I were to not like these poems, though I do just not intensely, it would feel like I were not liking *her*.\n\nOh, man, lots of acknowledgements to lots of people, including some very well-known artists, like Vuong and Sharon Olds. I cannot imagine thanking that many people. I do not think I know enough total, let alone people involved in my poetry. The number of people involved in my poetry is probably close to zero.",

Plus, Octopus Books advertised a chapbook competition in August (since then this has disappeared) that I wanted to submit to so I wanted to read more of what they had published. So I picked this book called Sexual Boats.\n\nWhen the package arrived it came with a third book I had not ordered. Weirde Sister. Ironically, I liked Weirde Sister far more than the Lockwood book or Sexual Boats.\n\nWeirde Sister is about the Salem witch trials, a kind of imaginary walk from the perspective of a woman later denounced as a witch a burned. It's vivid and strange. In some ways she truly is a witch, walking into the depths of a lake to do magic at its bottom with out women, but in other ways she is modern and aware of her persecution as prejudiced hunt.\n<blockquote>His daughter left to start a new life\n\nIn what would eventually become the computing industry\n\nThe villagers scattered\n\nThe weight of the hail lowered his fields six feet in altitude\n\nHe was attempting to flee when a final streak of hail severed his penis\n\nHis wounds weren't fatal but they were very demoralizing\n\nIn the sense that the governing morality of our time\n\nIs highly penis-oriented</blockquote>\nThe style is long sets of punctuation-free, capitalized lines. It is not a style I would expect I like. No rhyme, little rhythm, no sentence structure, just words swaying in the wind, moving through space, with the occasional stanza break. And yet I loved it. I loved the strangeness, the way the real mixed with the fantasy of an actual witch, I loved the humor and the sadness. For a long while I was convinced the author must be a women, though I saw the name 'James' on the cover.\n\nSexual Boats, the book I actually ordered, happens to be by the same author. Weirde Sister is much better.",

Instead it is mostly about Jude, a man who experienced terrible and sustained and varied sexual abuse his entire life up until basically 16 when he went to college.

That it had no real female characters, that it was not really about gay-ness, that all the main characters became hugely and inaccessibly wealthy and successful.

It\u2019s the basis of all creative and non-creative thought. Language has a ton of counter-factuals in which we easily understand things that are explicitly not true. Mostly this comes from being able to do conceptual blending, where we take two frames of thought and merge certain parts of them. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">This can be imaginative but it can also be mundane. e.g. Consider the form X is the Y of Z. This could be </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Paul is the father of Sally</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\"> or </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">poetry is the echo of the soul</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">. They both use conceptual blending to map one space onto another. The first projects the conceptual space of two unrelated people into our conception of fatherhood. In the second, we have the space of poetry and souls which are projected into our conception of echo. The first has a clear interpretation; the second less so; but in both it\u2019s the same act of mapping conceptual spaces onto each other.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">Conceptual blending is a way of compressing information. Forget exactly what they said about this.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">It\u2019s often a subconscious process. I think here they almost touch on the \u201cThinking Fast and Slow\u201d conception of how we think, in that conceptual blends often are the fast thinking and sometimes we need to break out that way of thinking to think about something more deeply or logically.</span>\n\n<i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">My response</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400;\">: I dig conceptual blending. It\u2019s unclear exactly how it is always a compression of information if it requires or draws on all our knowledge of the anchoring frames to create the blend. I guess the resulting blend is a compression, but only because it ties to other stuff we know. This doesn\u2019t exactly fit with my understanding on compression. But, I think the idea is good and it seems like essentially an extension of the conceptual metaphor theory, which is mapping one concept onto another with some shared overlap that increases our understanding of the target concept. Perhaps it\u2019s two-way conceptual metaphor theory.</span>",

Have read other stuff by Marquez -- Chronicles of a Death Foretold, Love in the Time of Cholera -- and they were great books. But this was one weird and crazy.\n\nIt follows a family in a small village somewhere and covers one hundred years of their progeny, from a time when gypsies came and sold them ice and a magic carpet (both equally grand to the people) through to a banana plantation coming in with Americans and barbed wire fences and union breaking and massacres, through a four year rain... So much goes on it is hard to describe.\n\nThere was a flighty element to the writing as there was no one main character but we would jump from person to person so quickly it was hard to notice at first. The writing was beautiful and engaging and yet seems like it should have felt like a laundry of what happened and what people were thinking.\n\nThe family itself is filled with strange characters, dreamers and inventors and a civil war hero and the original parents are cousins, constantly afraid their children will have pigs tails. Incest keeps coming back to the family and their downfall is when one of the boys (many generations past the original parents) falls in love with his aunt and basically sexually assaults her, which really causes her to fall in love with them and then they have a child. They are the only ones left of the bloodline and this child is their downfall; in the end they all die.\n\nAt the book club we couldn't figure out what the incest was about. Why was it so prominent? Did it mean something? Were we missing some cultural context?\n\nIt is a book I would read again, as so much happened it seemed to rush by and I couldn't touch every piece to really feel it.",

It's hard to describe it without it seeming silly or like fantasy. And yet it is not fantasy. It is classic 'literary', whatever exactly that means, it that it was very much about people and though it was strange and fantastical it had more of a magic realism feel than a fantasy one.\n\n(What makes fantasy different from the magic realism of Marquez or Murakami? I'm not sure.)\n\nThe style was unusual, almost play like in that everything was attributed but it helped with this aesthetic of everyone being a ghost and thus it is all more thoughts than words.\n\nHowever there were also sections which seemed like it was quotes from historical documents about Lincoln. It was a great gestalt to see twenty different descriptions of Lincoln's eyes all smashed up together, or to read of the party they held in the White House (while Willie was sick) and people saying the moon was high, there was no moon, the moon was bright orange, etc. etc.\n\n&nbsp;",

They mostly talk about the theories of Maturana (who comes from biology) and Heidegger (who comes from philosophy) and try to tie them together. The main idea is that language comes about through structural coupling \u2014 we want to talk in such a way that others understand and believe us. There is no \u2018objective\u2019 definition of water; it\u2019s contextual; but that\u2019s not to say there is no grounded definition: we use the word contextually in a way such that others continue to believe our commitment to common understanding. e.g. \u201cIs there water in the refrigerator?\u201d is an ambiguous question without the context: are we looking for something to drink or trying to find out what\u2019s wrong/if it\u2019s leaking? If we\u2019re in the former situation and reply \u201cYes, in the cells of the eggplant\u201d that\u2019s an obnoxious answer and too much of this will result in no longer believing we are committed to answering questions.\n\nMaturana did really interesting work in vision, showing that there\u2019s no \u2018absolute\u2019 processing of light but rather only contextual processing, at a biological level.\n\nHeidegger introduces this idea of \u2018thrown-ness\u2019 in which when we are using a hammer we are not thinking about using a hammer or the representation of a hammer; we simply are doing. We sometimes think and reflect, use representations or construct them, but not always (and maybe not mostly.) We are more often \u201cin\u201d it.\n\nThey also talk about breakdowns, in which our expectations are not met and we must reevaluate.\n\n*\n\nPart Two gets into AI and the reason rule-based systems (they talk about ELIZA, the block moving program, and the medical expert-systems, as well as Winston\u2019s analogy engine!) are not a good reflection of human cognition, which is situated and highly contextual and flexible.\n\n*\n\nPart Three gets into designing computer systems. They critique the management theory stuff by Simon that if we could just program in all the options we could make the right decisions. I liked their analogy of your car breaking down: you could fix it, or a buy a new car. But maybe you can\u2019t afford either. Maybe you take the bus and realize you don\u2019t need a car, or convince your company to intro a shuttle service. You could kill yourself \u2014 what constitutes all the options is ambiguous at best and most likely not real. Sometimes you can dissolve the problem instead of solving it.\n\nBut I wasn\u2019t super into this section. They talk about how calculators and word processors are great; they are good tools, they have thrown-ness. But this didn\u2019t feels super related to part one. It was mostly about design. Maybe I didn\u2019t read it closely enough. It felt a little up in the air in a way that the other parts were very grounded in theory and concrete.\n\nPerhaps I was expecting it to be more about how to get closer to human cognition than how to produce useful computational tools.\n\n\u2014\n\nI like the idea of thrown-ness, and their definition of language that allows shared meaning without needing absolute definitions of words.\n\nThrown-ness is super useful for understanding when a tool works. Makes me think of the low floors/high ceilings analogy for good tools.\n\nContext context context.\n\nPoetry in context: what do you want, what have you read, what do you expect?",

It felt like a short novel.\n\nI was captivated by it though I don't really understand certain aspects. It's a strange retelling of snow white where we follow Boy, a young girl abused by her rat-catching father in NYC who runs away shortly after finishing high school. She gets on a bus to a random, small town in Western Mass and ends up staying there, marrying Arturo, a jewelry maker with a daughter called Snow and a dead wife called Julie. At first Boy loves Snow, perhaps eight years old, a sweet little child. But then Boy becomes pregnant and upon the birth of her own daughter discovers that Arturo is actually a light-skinned black man; his entire family passing for white; Boy names her daughter Bird after Snow suggests some bird names.\n\nUpon this passing-as-white revelation, Boy discovers that Arturo has a second sister (or was it cousin...) living in Boston who does not want to pass as white; Arturo's mother sent her away. We are set up to believe that Boy will ask the sister to take her dark daughter, but instead Boy asks the sister to take Snow. I never understand this decision. Why does she suddenly hate Snow?\n\nWe then get a glimpse of Bird's strange world as a teenager, a dark kid in a small town in the midst of a strange drama. She is super curious about Snow and begins to send her letters; they strike up a friendship.\n\nBoy's father makes a visit and meets Bird.\n\nSnow comes to visit and befriends Bird, though Boy still hates Snow and now we learn more that Boy thinks people treat Snow like she is perfect and that this breeds in Snow a very pretentious and cruel personality; but is it true?\n\nFinally we a get a twist that Boy's close friend, a reporter, has been researching Boy's mother. The reporter had an abortion and wants to write a piece about why mother's abandon their children. What the reporter discovers is that Boy's father *is* her mother, that the mother got raped and then perhaps had some kind of personality disorder and transitioned into a man.\n\nThis is a crazy revelation that is hard to follow. We end with Boy arranging both Snow and Bird to try to go meet her 'mother'.\n\nIt's strange because Boy's mother is set up, based on the research, to be a kind and progressive woman; but Boy's father is terribly, physically abusive. It's hard to imagine that kind of switch. And why does Boy want to go see him or her?\n\nWe are having a book club on this book so hopefully others will have some insight.",

It's funny how much that can affect my perception of the story.\n\nIt was good, strange, pretty much what people say. Intriguing that Gregor does so much for his family but they seem happier when they are forced to be on their own without his help. I guess that's probably the main, depressing point of the story.\n\nPerhaps because it is so famous and so referenced the story itself was a little underwhelming.

Good but not genius; not because it is not genius but because by now it feels almost like a trope.",

                    "notes": "I remember this book being around during my childhood--probably around the time I moved to the U.S. when I was 15. I remember the term, presumably my mum had been reading about it. Then, recently, a good friend of mine interviewed me about 'home'; she was doing a whole series of interviews. I talked a lot about a lack of physical home for me, given the cross-world move and also that my parents have moved away even from where we first lived in the U.S. Then she gave me this book.\n\nThe book is, in some way, simple. It is explanatory, it is helpful. It is a lot of short narratives from Third Culture Kids, a lot of advice. Accessible is perhaps the word I'm looking for. There is no larger narrative. It is expository. But is also dense; the pages are thin and it took me longer to read than I expected. While interesting, the lack of narrative sometimes made it hard to hold on.\n\nThird Culture Kid: loosely defined, someone who has made one or more physical moves into different cultures during their childhood (aka formative years.) They also look at how there are many similarities between TCKs and Cross Cultural Kids, which could include adoptees, biracial kids, kids who speak a different language at home or whose parents are immigrants. However, TCKs often has a 'passport country' they return to as adults.\n\nI don't think I'm quite a TCK. I feel more like an immigrant, at this point, who immigrated during childhood. However, I related to many scenarios in the book: not understanding why my friends weren't concerned with events happening in other countries, struggling to define what or where 'home' is, never knowing how to answer 'where are you from', using my move to make myself feel special or to explain my short-comings... The other distinction I would make, that makes me not quite a TCK, is that the American and Australian cultures are not that different -- certainly closer than Togo and Norway, or many other combinations TCKs experience.\n\nI enjoyed the book. I enjoyed the enumeration of the benefits of being a TCK and the many tactics to reduce the detriments. I enjoyed rethinking my own move and how it affected me. I briefly talked to my parents about it, I would like to more, to discuss their memories of me during the move. I think there are many pieces I have blocked out.",

Then I was interested in reading more books by black women, and again it popped up. I got it from the NYC public library and read it in a dash.\n\nIt is somewhere between poetry and a novel and a memoir. Jacqueline tells her own story of growing up on Ohio and then South Carolina and then Brooklyn, topping out somewhere around age 10. She writes in an easy poetic form that is almost more stream of consciousness than poetry, though it slows the reader down and, I think, helps get into the mind of a very young girl.\n\nPart of the story is about her family, her mother leaving her father, her father not wanting to return to the South, the birth of her little brother, the genius of her sister Dell (always reading) and her brother Hope (interested in science), her grandparents in Greenville, her grandfather who she is particularly close to, her grandmother's religion (Jehovah's Witness) and her grandfather not participating. But it also about the way she is treated differently in Greenville as a black child -- sitting at the back of the bus, not being served in Walmart. And the protests and activism going on at the time, from the perspective of a five year old girl.\n\nBut it is also about her becoming a writer, making up endless stories as a child, being chided for this, being chided for reading below her level, her eagerness to write, her excitement as making up things 'too good' to believe. It is a wonderful development, how sure she is in her desire, how natural or innate it seems to her.\n\nThe book is fascinating and delightful, vivid in this strange way of tunneling into a little girl's mind and re-seeing everything. It was a fairly fast read, the poetic form makes it short, but it was delightful. Maybe I should buy a copy so that I can read it again later.",

She got a scholarship to go to a fancy middleschool in the rich neighbourhood nearby and talks about how it devastated her, it crushed her sense of being really smart, but also how it showed her that the rich white did far more drugs, sold more drugs, and were never afraid of getting caught. Her poor black friends in her neighbourhood did little to be in trouble and yet were arrested time and time again.\n\nHer brother had schizophrenia, and she talks about the tragedy of him being in and our jail, being terrified of jail where years later they learnt that the guards truly tortured the inmates, though if they call 911 or took him to the hospital there was a good chance he would go back to jail. It was a catch 22 they could never truly break, though they tried hard to get him back on his feet.\n\nShe saw the power of community organizing, found a non-biological family that supported her, realized she was queer but ended up being in a long term, hinted-at-non-monogamous relationship with a man who studied chinese medicine and wanted to be a healer.\n\nIt was a rough, but important, read, to see where she is coming from, how hard she worked and continues to work to try to stop the unthinkable oppression she and her peers and her family experienced and continue to experience.",

Like Wizard of Earthsea, I took a while to get into this book, getting bored at the politics (I am bored even with the politics of my own country; I am hard-pressed to be invested in fictional politics) but engaged when they are out on the ice, just traveling. In this book an emissary from a galactical trading company arrives on the isolated planet Winter to convince them to join the trading company. But on Winter people don't have gender; rather once a month they grow genitals depending on who is around and have sex only then. This means they could be both a mother and a father. There is even a pregnant king.\n\nThe gender politics are fascinating, the way the emissary finds them at times male, at times female, though of course they are neither. He often finds their sexuality base -- as in primitive, for there are little inhibitions around sex (when they are in heat) and to him that makes them seem animal. He also wonders how much of their society, which has no war, is due to the genderlessness or due to the harsh climate; the planet is called Winter due to it being very cold all the time.\n\nOverall I would recommend the book, though I was not super into it.

The story is almost fantastical; this journalist in his 50s gets laid off from Newsweek, where he was the technology editor, and decides to join a startup that looks like it will IPO and make some money. He remembers writing about the 2000s dotcom bust and how even though it went bust, lots of people made lots of money. He wants to get in on it.\n\nSo he gets a job at Hubspot, interviewed by the co-founders and hired by the VP of marketing or some other high level exec. Hubspot! Just down in Cambridge. But on his first day there are foreboding signs. No one is there to meet him. Eventually a young guy comes, a guy in his 20s that reminders the author of interns he had at Newsweek, and at some point the author realizes that this young guy is actually his boss. Holy shit.\n\nThe people who hired him never, ever come to see him. Instead he is thrown into the blogging team, writing inane, terrible articles. After complaining about this too loudly they move him onto the sales floor, a huge open area where 100 frat bros walk around with headsets throwing footballs to themselves and cold calling customers to get them to sign up. It's a terrible cacophony, but at this point the author forces to think of himself on an anthropological mission.\n\nEventually he gets a new boss, someone around his age who seems respectable. But that too falls apart as this new boss inexplicably starts to gaslight him, sending him daily emails about his failings, the failings of his work, his failure to commit to the company, to go out to drinks, etc. It's torturous, and the author needs to get out, which he does, eventually, after making about $60k in the IPO and securing a job back as an actual journalist.\n\nPart of the shock of this story is the culture of Hubspot, a culture of 20-year old white people who are so incredibly peppy and optimistic and praising that this 50-year-old, sarcastic journalist can hardly stand it. Part of it is the peppiness, sure, but part is also that these people are crap at their jobs, have no experience but consider themselves industry leaders.\n\nThe whole thing was fascinating, scary, weird; a great read, a worrisome sign. Were the companies I was at like this? He saw almost exclusively the marketing side; I see mostly the engineering.",

In the future planet, Toussaint, everyone has a 'nanny' AI in their ear that helps them but also helps keep the peace. It's a utopia future, with no manual labor and crazy bio-design stuff. Instead of a death penalty, they send people to the New Half-Way Tree, a parallel planet that doesn't have any of the tech or AI of Toussaint.\n\nThe main character, Tan-Tan, her mother cheats on her father, so her father challenges the guy to a duel -- instead of fighting fairly, he poisons the guy, which basically gets him sent to the New Half-Way Tree. He sneaks Tan-Tan along with him, which is a bit of a dick move but it turns out he's really a monster and abuses her in the New Half-Way Tree.\n\nAs a quick summary, Tan-Tan kills Antonio and runs away (it's eye for eye) and lives with these half-beast people in the forest. She becomes the Midnight Robber, doing good in the small colonies on the New Half-Way Tree. But she gets kicked out of half-beast people, too, because her mother-in-law finds their secret hideout trying to kill Tan-Tan for killing Antonio. Eventually Tan-Tan has a face-off with the mother-in-law and makes some peace. Then she has her child, Antonio's child, and it turns out the nanny AI was able to make its way into the kid. It ends with Tan-Tan giving birth.\n\nCraziness.",

I read it on the Kindle.\n\nThis book followed my general takeaway from pop science: first third hard by digestible facts, second third interesting by less authoritative, final third a little wild and out there. It starts by looking at evidence for different theories of early humankind communities, and is pretty even handed about it all -- telling you the different theories, telling you the evidence, telling you that we can't really know and often there is scant evidence. There were lots of different early communities, and even the extinction of the neanderthals is not fully understood. He also gets into the beginning of agriculture, and the possible overall (immediate) net negative for societies to do this -- certainly it allowed for larger societies, but those larger societies tended to have more bad-off people than the smaller tribes. He takes us into the modern day, and insightfully notes how (generally) successfully nation-states are at allowing *huge* numbers of people to peacefully coexist (within them) which is pretty crazy when you think about it. For instance, I'm currently stuck on a bus from Boston to New York with about 30 other people and I have no real fear that one of them will kill me for my computer. Wow! Thanks, large societal structures.\n\nI remember the very end getting a bit crazy, probably about AI or something silly.

She doesn't dive deep into the details of her experience, though at one point she does give us a cursory overview of what exactly happened. She discusses whether or not the reader needs to know these details in order to believe or understand her experience, and challenges the need for bad experiences to exist as torture porn for the reader.\n\nShe writes in a casual, short style, with many short chapters falling after each other like her thoughts falling into us. I love this style as it felt so much like getting into her head. She's funny, and acerbic, and very honest about her experience in her body.

I did not dig this book. It was so much talking, mostly narration of side character's lives and their tribulations and thoughts and perspectives. Action was almost non-existant. I guess the narrator has bought a house in London and is getting it renovated; her (teenage?) sons are staying elsewhere; she is divorced (recently?); her new downstairs neighbors are jerks; she is writer and gives a talk with other memoirists. We hear almost nothing of her -- she is empty, flat -- but so much of anyone she happens to bump into it.\n\nI just couldn't care for it. Couldn't care for the incessant telling of what is happening in other people's lives, only to never return to them.

The book tracks two lineages from two daughters of the same mother in Africa. One of the daughters stays in Africa, the other is taken on a slave ship to the United States. It is a book where every chapter you get a glimpse into the life of a new character, back-and-forth between the American and African line always moving down a generation. Each chapter could\u2019ve been the center of their own novel, and each character so real, so full of tragedy and also triumph and I could\u2019ve lived with each one for so much longer. But the gestalt of them all is what made the book unique, see the past several hundred years in individual lives was amazing in a way that is hard to explain or hard to appreciate even if I knew the contents of the history before reading it.\n\nWe end up comparing a lot of books in our book club to A Little Life, which at this point seems closer to torture porn then great literature. And Homegoing had so much suffering ,but unlike in A Little Life the suffering is tied to the realities of our society and our history and each individual suffering seems in proportion to how we know the world works. In A Little Life the suffering is so random and not that some suffering in life isn\u2019t random but there is something about Homegoing in which the suffering serves to tell us about the consequences of our actions. Lots of the sufferers are also those that hurt, but also all of the sufferers find some time at some point. The book is not all about pain, most of the couples are loving and committed, which I guess also happened in A Little Life, toward the end. Perhaps it is a matter of focus. Or intent. Homegoing seems to want the reader to reflect on our history and its consequences; it uses the suffering to push this. What was A Little Life asking of the reader?\n\nStill, Homegoing stood so strong on its own legs. I hope to read it again.",

It was easy to read like The Big Short, and similar in other ways. I thought it would mostly be about the relationship between Kahnemann and Tversky, given what my mum had told me when she recommended it, but it was very much about their work. Their relationship was central but at the beginning it definitely talked mostly about the ideas. I guess this is something that Michael Lewis does so well, he somehow makes the book all about people as well as the ideas. The ending was definitely emotional and very much about the people, not at all about the work.\n\nThis book also made me think a lot about the speech by Richard Hamming I recently read in which he talks about why or how some scientists do great work -- he defined great as nobel prize winning or worthy of a nobel prize. The two or three things that stuck out to me from his speech was that it required that he neglect his wife to an extent as well as his comment about which would you rather be: a person who does great work or a person who changes the system? And that way he seemed to be saying the great work requires dedication that means you cannot dedicate yourself to other things. In the Undoing Project Danny makes a big commitment to his second wife by moving to the US to be with her, and this tremendously shifts his relationship with Amos (though perhaps it would\u2019ve shifted it anyway). Amos is kind of what you would expect from someone who would do great work, in terms of neglecting other things, but Danny perhaps not. In Hamming\u2019s speech he talks of people he expected and didn\u2019t expect to do great work and how those expectations sometimes but did not always pan out.\n\nDuring bookclub for Homegoing Dan kept talking about how the book treats its characters with such compassion. I kind of feel that way in this book too, the way Danny and Amos are portrayed as a real also I guess fragile or understandable. Even when they do things that might be wrong or mean they\u2019re treated tenderly.",

Steven and I read parts of it out loud together and found it hilarious and silly. \"You need to let your socks relax,\" etc. I half-jokingly recommended it to Silas, who seemed to be struggling with what to do with all his stuff. Then he read it and really liked it, so I decided to read it too when I found it in the AirBnB I was at in New Orleans (for the NAACL conference.)\n\nIt's a good, easy read and I actually really did like it's central premise: keep things around that bring you joy. Don't worry about having too much or too little; if you love everything you have then you'll be happy with it. I liked the idea that you should know everything you have -- she's really into making sure you touch it -- and although the way she says it comes off as eccentric, I found ideas underneath I liked. The reason you have to touch it is so that you really make sure you know what it is, where it is, instead of assuming you know everything in that pile and whether or not you want it. Even the socks thing seemed less silly: rolling over the top of your socks wears out the elastic.\n\nI did try to follow her advice, and went through my clothes and books and things at my desk and got rid of a bunch of stuff. I think it went well; though honestly I do stuff like that quite often, probably because I've moved a bunch and I'm always trying to slim down before I move. But I think it's good to go through all my clothes every year or so, remember what I have and get rid of what I'm tired of. (Though sometimes it is nice to rediscover a piece of clothing I had forgotten.)\n\nWhile I'm not sure it changed my life, it definitely stuck with me as a good guiding principle. In fact, I think it made me more comfortable buying more books, because they really give me joy. I've never felt good owning a lot of books, because they are heavy and take up a lot of space. But, if they make me happy, I should prioritize them.",

It's starts with this tantalizing idea that women develop the ability to control and send electricity from their fingertips, and it's this revelation to see how the power dynamics change when women are more physically powerful. It starts in teenagers, but then they are able to awaken it in older women. At the beginning, it feels good, almost hedonic, to read about these women overthrow their abusers and bosses, but as the story continues it grows dark as now it is simply women often abusing men.\n\nIt is told through the perspective of several different people: a foster kid abused by her foster father, who goes on to start a new religion that centers on women and their power; a kid in a mafia-esque family, who goes on to rule the family business, a woman who goes into politics, and a man who becomes an early journalist documenting the power and the political changes it instigates.\n\nIt is book-ended by Naomi (the actual author) emailing with Neil (the fictitious author). Neil is explaining his historical fiction/reimagining of the time when women gain their ability, and Naomi is mildly chiding him for the 'pornographic' descriptions of boy gangs, and suggesting he publish under a female pen name if he doesn't want it to be labeled as men's fiction. It's meant to place the story in the context of a different world in which women have all the power, and men are struggling to gain their rights.\n\nThe moral of the story seems to be that power corrupts, and thus wishing for more power won't necessarily fix problems in society, but rather shift who those problems most effect. This is an old, old moral, but Alderman does it so well, in such detail, and so evocatively.",

Yet I couldn't remember what happened -- I could never predict what would come next. Even reading the blurb I thought I had heard it before. Perhaps I read it in high school and simply forgot the plot, but recalled each piece as I read it.\n\nKindred is a fantastic, pretty old book about a black woman, Dana, from the 70s getting randomly thrown back to the time of her white great-great-great-...-grandfather, Rufus, first when he is a kid on a slave-owning plantation, but then again and again, later when he is running the plantation and owns all the slaves. She seems to get drawn when he is in danger and so she saves him. This is what draws them together. He falls in love with one of the slave girls, Alice, who he ends up having children with and is the blood-line of Dana. Dana looks very similar to Alice, which ends up causing problems when Alice kills herself (because Rufus pretended to sell their children into slavery to try to control Alice more) and Dana is the one left that Rufus wants to have and control.\n\nSimilar to The Power, despite the fantastical underpinnings of the story it is incredibly real and, as with any story about slavery, heart-breaking and full and lose-loses for the main character. The main character does what she can to try make Rufus better, and treat the slaves better, but there is little she can do and we see him grow from a small, angry, confused child into a cruel adult.\n\nSome plot points: Dana is married to a white man. At one point he gets pulled into the past with her, because he holds onto her when she begins to travel and he goes too. But then, when she travels back (which she doesn't have much control over, seems to be when her life is in danger) he isn't with her and thus he gets stuck in the past for 8 eight years (which is only a couple weeks in their normal time). He moves further north to help with the underground railroad, but it's clear it effects him. Rufus falls in love with Alice when they are very young, and sells the man she tries to escape with in order to keep her with him. They have sex, but it's clear he coerces her, and she never really loves him but simply is doing her best to survive. He thinks he loves her, but really he owns and controls her. Dana is a writer, and so is her husband. Butler has said that the real complicit character is her husband, a white man who is against slavery but still only ambiguously good for Dana; the other white men are clearly bad, but at least Dana can recognize this.",

It's a strange and sad tale about these two white kids, an older girl (early teens?) and younger boy (10 or so?), surviving a plane crash in the Australian desert and then wandering around, eventually running into an Aboriginal boy who helps them out. The girl is cruel, not wanting to trust the Aboriginal because he is black and 'savage', but the boy, younger, hasn't seemed to been indoctrinated into white supremacy yet and simply wants the Aboriginal to help them, and is open and honest and fun.\n\nThen the Aboriginal contracts a cold from one of the kids and, never having experienced or seen anyone experience a cold before, thinks he is dying. By force of will he then does die, convinced of his death despite the fact that the cold would have gone away. Still, before dying he leads them almost to safety, and after his death they continue on over a hill to find an oasis, where they survive until another group of Aboriginals find them and return them to the nearest city.\n\nOr perhaps he dies because he thinks the girl has seen his death. At some point he sees her bathing nude, or something of the sort, or something else happens that she disapproves of, and so she glares at him. He takes this to mean she has seen his death, that she is some kind of witch who can see these things, and from then on is simply waiting for death to arrive. Perhaps the cold is simply the indication that his death has arrived.\n\nThe descriptions of the desert are wonderful and vivid. The younger boy dances and whoops with the Aboriginal, satisfied to go naked, while the girl is embarrassed and ashamed even of the Aboriginals nudity. I think the Aboriginal was on walkabout, a coming-of-age test for young boys to go out into the desert and survive on their own for some period of time.",

I also thought his predictions about what computers could do to be fairly weak and uninformed, but then again perhaps I shouldn't have expected much. He's a chess master, not a computer scientist.\n\nI didn't expect to be so enthralled with the story about Deep Blue, though, and it was truly fascinating. He had beat the computer one year before, in a very convivial game, and was partial to helping IBM improve the technology. However, the game was so popular, and brought IBM so much attention and stock value, that they got cagey after the first match, intent to win the second time around just a year away. So they didn't give Kasparov any of the information you would normally get, like access to previously played games, and were generally dicks during the game. There were a lot of things I hadn't expected to be problematic, like what to do if the computer crashes (since it loses its history and may play a different move when rebooted) and if you need to tell the human opponent that it crashed (could just be taking a long time to play the move). Also, sometimes they wouldn't play the computer's move right away, to psych out the opponent, which is legal -- a human can do that -- but is pretty weird because it's the people operating the computer making that decision, not the computer itself.\n\nSo the lead-up to the game and the game itself was riveting, as was the aftermath. It seems like Kasparov lost mostly for psychological reasons -- like one game he forfeited even though he wouldn't have necessarily lost -- though that doesn't make it less of a loss. They never released the computer or its program, which Kasparov thought was because if they did it would become clear that it wasn't actually that good i.e. in more calm (aka fair?) circumstances. But he knew computers were on their way up and would beat humans in his lifetime.\n\nAs an instructor, he noticed that kids could get better much faster when they had computers to analyze their moves and play against them. I remember Walther mentioning something similar with Go, that the computer programs helped him analyze his games, and before that he would have had to find an instructor to sit down with. It also made chess more popular, not less, because of all the press but also because it became easier to access the computer programs and generally made chess more accessible.\n\nSo kids got better, faster. But some would get stuck, not really knowing what was going on but just very good at playing like the computer programs. Basically, the ones who trusted the computer too much never could become really good because they never learned how to analyze the board themselves, or make their own calls.\n\nSo it was a fascinating book, just a shame that he didn't get to part about human-computer collaboration.",

Danny got a lot of the algorithm stuff that I struggled with, and it was especially useful to go over the proof of Godel's incompleteness theorem with him.\n\nUnfortunately I don't think this blog post will do justice to my reading -- need to get better at doing this sooner to when I finish the book. However, the book left a lot with me: I think I have a sketch of Godel's incompleteness theorem still in my mind, and a sketch of Turing's thesis that the brain must be like a computer because we can only come up with one (mathematical) way of explaining how to solve problems and therefore all things that solve problems must have this similarity.\n\nThe book is a good jaunt through some mathematical and algorithmic ideas. I found the parts about DNA and biology less interesting, but in the 70s it was probably much more exciting. The weird masochistic relationship between Achilles and the Turtle in the dialogues in between chapters did start to irk me at some point; I don't think Hofstadter was making any point about stupid people (rather I think he was just setting up clever and more clever threads of jokes and puns and whatnot) but it came off wrong to me, the way the Turtle was often effectively gaslighting Achilles, even if it was meant to come off as a point about logic.\n\nHofstadter is definitely a weird guy, and that came through and through the book, so much so that I'd be curious to read some of his other work (I mean I have read (most of ) Le Ton Beau de Marot but he has written a lot more), and in his introduction he talks about the ease of getting GEB published, which made me reminisce somewhat of an easier time for publishing.\n\nStill, the book was majestic and ambitious; I think it delivered a good deal on that ambition, working slowly into number theory and then proofs thereof without reading at all like a textbook. The references to music and art were good, but not great, I didn't feel a lot of connection to his appreciation of art, which seemed very tied to symmetry and order and such things, as opposed to cultural context, but probably par for the course for somewhat more mathematically inclined.\n\nHm, what else. I would consider reading it again, to really get it into my head. He has some good metaphors about how we understand other people, like how we each have a map in our head of different concepts and experiences, and if they overlap enough with someone else's map we're able to navigate but if the differences are too large them we become lost. This felt very real to me when trying to talk to people with whom I struggle to find common ground; our maps are too different and we can't always find the parts that overlap or match. The basic idea of Godel's incompleteness theorem is that any sufficiently powerful system must contain a contradiction -- you can't have a system that could produce interesting/meaningful results and have a system that is internally consistent. It's a powerful idea, and a fascinating metaphor.",

The essay was great, touching on a lot of issues about gender and emotion in the workplace, and at the end said she'd recently come out with her first novel, so I requested it from the library.\n\nOne of those novels I just inhaled. Super weird, super interesting, super across genres about a young woman in New York whose parents died shortly before or after her going to college, and her experience in New York really severed from any family whatsoever--her parents from China, she growing up partially in China with her parents and then grandparents when her parents moved to the U.S. then in the U.S. when her parents brought her over. She works at a company that makes books, or deals with the contractors that make books; in particular she works on their Bibles, all of which are made in China (the irony is not lost of the men in China who run the factories).\n\nThis alone is fascinating enough, but it's also about Shen Fever, which basically lobotomizes those it infects--the infected people just go through their typical routine, setting the table, walking back to their room, again and again and again until they eventually die of starvation. They lose their mind. Shen Fever sweeps the world, including New York, and our heroin is one of the few people left in New York, never having contracted it.\n\nBut it's also about how she's pregnant, never told her boyfriend who is tired of the canned and capitalist New York, before Shen Fever comes he begs her to go with him on a sailing trip and settle somewhere in the Northwest. But she sticks with her Bible job. Discovers she's pregnant. New York becomes vacant. She photographs it, posting the photos online for the few people left, mostly in the Netherlands where the cold holds back the infection.\n\nShe eventually drives out of the city, picked up by a small group of survivors led by this pretty crazy guy who starts new rituals and religions for them, leading them up to a suburb of Chicago (god, why, so cold! seems hard to survive up there) where there is a mall he kind of owns (why do they care about ownership) and he wants them all to live there. He's truly a maddening character, manipulative, and our heroine tries to keep the pregnancy from him, but eventually he finds out and he cages her in one of the mall shops, convinced, rightly, that she'll try to escape.\n\nShe does try to escape, and does, apparently this crazy guy (Bob? some banal name like that) kind of has Shen Fever, wanders around the mall at night in a trance, and she gets away driving to the center of Chicago and that is where the story leaves us, her escaping, looking upon the emptied city.\n\nIt was so good I read reviews afterward--a good way to bask in the glow of a book--and they highlighted how multi-genre this book was: zombie, coming of age, immigrant, capitalist critique, and also kind of boring, in that the characters are maddeningly chill, the crazy leader is more middle management than evil, even our heroine just floats along, that maybe the main thrust of the book is that we've become the walking dead, like those with Shen Fever who don't want to eat our brains but are content to just relive, again and again, the most banal aspects of our lives and isn't that the scariest thing of all?\n\nIt's a terrifically, amazing book.",

                    "notes": "DiAngelo unpacks her perspective on the problems white people have with racism, from her perspective as a white person and as someone who has conducted anti-racism trainings for many years. The basic idea, to me, is that white people are so rarely challenged in their identity as good people, because in a white supremacist society white people are inherently the good ones, that when anyone even suggests a white person may have done something racist, instead of considering and even changing their actions, they panic and generally attack the person who suggested they did something wrong.\n\nI didn't phrase that well, and lots more goes into the book, but to me that was the main tenant: we are fragile, and because we are fragile we refuse to change. Or, in other words, we believe we are not racist because we do not lynch people in the street, and therefore we must never be doing anything wrong.\n\nBut we are doing things wrong, even if our only offense is living in and profiting off a society in which we are considered supreme. There is so much here: just because you don't know any black people doesn't make you immune from racism, in fact maybe you should consider why it is you don't know any black people. Racism isn't about you as an individual being cruel to others; it's a societal problem we are all complicit in. None of us are immune for racism. DiAngelo shares stories of herself trying to take responsibility for when her actions cause harm, even though she did not intend them to. This was a book club book, and one of the people who attended, a woman of color, said it would be truly amazing if anyone ever did that with her -- took responsibility for doing some that caused her harm in some way, and asked her what they could do better next time.\n\nIt was such an important book that I recommend it to everyone, well, all my white friends. But it's a tricky book, because so many people, as the book says, don't want to consider themselves as racist, or consider themselves complicit. This is, of course, the problem the book tries to unravel: how we need to take responsibility for this, instead of lashing out. Lashing out perpetuates racism; it both says that we as white people are inscrutable but also makes sure nothing will change, that we won't change. And of course, that is the problem: as white people we may not see the need for change, or worse we may not want change. But that's what white supremacy is. And that's why we need to be open to critique, and acknowledge how we participate in racism, and try to change the system.",

That poem was striking, mostly for the content. I didn't find Nelson's language to really capture me. But maybe I didn't spend enough time with the book.

This book deals in gender, or its fluidity; at the start the author notes that they use a certain symbol (which I learned later, from someone at the book club, is a music symbol for returning to the start of a piece) as the pronoun for a character in the book called the Bandleader, and that it's meant to be read as a sharp, inhaled breath.\n\nThis book had an almost narrative quality, moving between the speaker's childhood frustration with her father and notes to Major General about her brother in the army and about the speaker's adult relationship with the Bandleader. Some of the poems, to me, seemed to be from the perspective of the speaker's brother in the army, which made it feel like perhaps the speaker was the brother as well, that maybe the brother was the male incarnation of the speaker.\n\nAlso during book club someone noted that many of the poems, perhaps only the Bandleader ones, could be read across the page spread as well as down each page individually. In book club we uncovered a lot of musical themes, and there was a dense richness to this book that I really appreciated, because on their own the poems were also haunting and beautiful, but the context and woven references were a nice addition.\n\nShortly after we read the book I discovered one of Calvocoressi's poems was recently published in the New Yorker, Hammond B3 Organ Cistern, a wild and wonderful poem about the speaker not wanting to kill herself and how wonderful that feels. I actually liked it more than the others in the book we read, the rhythm was stronger and the message clearer; it stood a bit better on its own.\n\nI think another reason I liked the book was that it's ambiguity seemed to be driving at this purpose of considering gender as ambiguous; whereas often I just find the ambiguity in a single poem or collection to be a frustrating kind of challenge or purposeful hiding, that normal frustration that poetry is kind of snobbish. Here, though, I felt it was tied down to gender and the confusion that surrounds it.",

The reviews on the back mentioned it was partially about the Columbine school shooting, but I couldn't quite figure out when reading it if the speaker (or poet) was there at the shooting or not. There was definitely imagery from the shooting, as well as general teenage angst, but it was never quite specific enough so I wasn't sure.\n\nIt was almost surrealist, the imagery flitting in and out of focus, no poem holding a line of thought long enough to make sense before it broke into shattered flowers (or whatnot). For me, I tried to make it an exercise of letting go, as I tend to write poetry closer to prose than perhaps is warranted. Still, it felt a little lost, with no narrative thread and really nothing I found to ground it. Beautiful, though.\n\nAt the book club we debated the merits of the Columbine imagery, as the poet hadn't been there but was simply a teenager when it occurred. One guy complained that it was irresponsible to write about Columbine in such an obscured way; others said it would have been worse if the poet had included more violence if she hadn't been there--a type of exploitation or fetishization. The violence was kept at a distance, though there it mostly focused on adolescence and anger.\n\nOne person at the book club had done an incredibly close reading, keeping track of the various images and noting how they all came together in the final poem. I enjoyed that the poems got richer as I read them more; they gave back when you paid attention. Still, there was so little for me to hold onto.",

He said it scans a bit like a self-help book, but is actually pretty amazing, and that fits well with my experience. The blurb and cover make it seem like a 'how to be your best self' kind of crap, but her ideas were actually deep and interesting. It is a book I'd like to own, so I can reference it later; just looking over the chapters helps me recall what's important when planning an event, how to focus. Unfortunately I haven't seen it out in paperback yet, and I don't really like hardcover books, so I guess I'll have to wait a bit.\n\nShe starts by talking about how gatherings should have purpose, a specific purpose, and this is the guiding star planning. Without a purpose, or with a vague purpose, you won't know if it should be big or small, casual or formal, who to invite, etc. Although this sounds trivial, it's really not: I was planning this event and we just kind of did it because we thought it would be nice to end the seminar with an event; we had to sit and choose a stronger purpose.\n\nShe talks about the importance of not inviting everyone, and how different sized groups effect the type of gathering, how to be a good host (and how that is a job), and different ways to get people to be more genuine and off-the-cuff, rather than inhabiting and exposing their standard posture.\n\nIt was a great book that I could benefit from reading again, or reading parts of when relevant.",

It foreshadows the apocalypse constantly, most clearly in one of the characters, Chloe, continually and accurately dreams of different ways it might happen. At first I though, okay, maybe a couple chapters in. Then, maybe the middle. Then, maybe three fourths. Then, at the end. But at the end the apocalypse becomes more of a metaphor, or like the idea of the apocalypse, being so close, it the apocalypse itself. It never comes.\n\nI liked the book, four characters: Chloe, a popular girl at a big public highschool in (near?) DC, Steven, the son of a diplomat turned spy-dealer-something who travels the world with his dad and basically doesn't go to school, Ethan (ooh I am forgetting the names already) whose very rich father kills himself in jail after being charged with something and proceeds to get himself expelled from almost all the private schools in DC, and Molly, whose mother dies in an accident when she is around 8 and ends up living with her father in this house in the woods, as her father is worried/preparing for the apocalypse. They're all fascinating characters, and the author does high school super well, a kind of amped up glamor of high school emotions and friendships and crazy parties but more fleshed out and empathetic than something like Mean Girls/Heathers or other more standard high school drama.\n\nThe book is long, so I won't go into all the events, but I was disappointed about not actually getting to the apocalypse, and not even all the characters meeting. Chloe and Ethan end up in the same high school, and Steven and Molly pass paths somewhere (some place they keep nuclear missiles?) but they never really get to know each other.\n\nI'm not sure I needed it to be more traditional story arc, I just felt it built a huge amount of tension (masterfully!) that was never released.",

There is maybe a hope (or fear) that writing on a computer changed the way we write so fundamentally that novels themselves changed -- maybe that writers were more prodigious, or the writing was somehow better (or worse), but none of that really plays out, at least in his historical analysis.\n\nBut the act of writing itself changed dramatically, and the archives that we can study have changed. Writing became faster, in many ways easier, and definitely easier to edit. Gone are the drafts with the edits, the white-out, the paper trail; but also the staccato of the typewriter, often times the secretary who would re-type the drafts. Collaboration became easier, especially with connections via modem.\n\nComputing ushered in an exciting time, and at the beginning (say, the 1980s,) there were many options for word processors, various writers had their favorites, unlike now in a world dominated by Microsoft Word.",

The book is a series of essays about the political landscape of the U.S. in 2016; in between each essay is a mini-essay called 'Book of Days' and indexed by each month in the year. These mini-essays are just a series of sentences that describe current events that happened that month. At first I found them overwhelming and tough to read, not very enjoyable, but I came to love the way he builds this gestalt by just listing through the million things happening the world, and the way they come together through ordering and when he puts disparate events into the same sentences. It reminded me of what was happening, though there were also things I hadn't heard of. It reminded me a bit of sections of The Big Short (the movie) in which they show a collection of images that come together to give you a sense of the feel of the culture of the world at that time, all the things that were going on in the world *besides* the stock market.\n\nThe essays were also great, following Hillary Clinton and Ted Cruz and Donald Trump through their campaigns, through the country. Depressing, but also uplighting in how he contextualizes our time with The Great Depression, and other major downfalls, the failure of the Republicans *and* Democrats to really represent the middle and lower class, some political scientists and commentators that predicted, long ago, that we'd get here. (Though, with enough predictions someone gets it right.)\n\nThe prose is beautiful, clearly novelistic, almost reminding me of Patricia Lockwood's memoir and how it felt so much like her crazy poetry.

The book follows the story of a young girl, Cora, escaping from a plantation, and her experience in various stop points along the way: South Carolina, where she has a job but they try to sterilize her, hiding in an attic in North Carolina, where they try to get rid of all black people in the state, the Valentine Farm in Indiana, where eventually there is a massacre, and finally she comes out the \"end\" of the railroad, someplace out west, and gets on a cart with a black man riding out west. Each time she takes a literal railroad, built under the ground, to another place.\n\nIt's a haunting, powerful story, as in the wake of Cora's continual escape people she has come to trust are murdered, and she continues to have horrible experiences, all partly due to a slave catcher out to get her. Cora's mother escaped when she was young, and she always felt resentment towards this, though we learn in the novel that her mother actually died trying to return to Cora.",

It's about a woman who's parents died while she was in college (at Columbia? Barnard?) and though she gets a job as a docent (or something similar) at a small gallery in Chelsea, she just doesn't care to... do anything. Or be anyone. She has one friend who she doesn't like much, but seems to care for in some way despite treating her poorly. She has lots of money, maybe from her parents death. So she decides to try to sleep for a whole year.\n\nShe finds a psychiatrist who will prescribe her almost anything, and the psychiatrist is also nuts, very strange. She tries a bunch of different drugs, mostly laying around in bed eating ice cream and watching tv. But she wants to be really out of it, so she eventually gets prescribed a drug that makes her black out for several days at a time. At first she doesn't like this, because during the black out she often goes and parties--bad, because she wants to be resting. So she gets an artist she knows to act as her jailor, and make sure she stays in her room the whole time by locking her in.\n\nIt's just really weird. At one point her friend's mother dies, and she attends the funeral in a fucked up state. After about a year of her drugging herself, she rebirths into the world and, I guess, is meant to be better, or feel better, and be less of a jerk. At the end 9/11 happens, and her friend dies in the attacks.\n\nThe main character is hypnotically terrible, and at the end of her \"rest\" it's unclear to me what has happens; she doesn't seem particularly good or bad (in whatever respect) but rather simply empty.\n\nI liked this book a lot, but I still don't really know what it's about. Apparently the reviews are all over the place as to what the books themes were. Anti-capitalism? Self-care? Art?\n\nI think it was haunting in its ability to show a crappy person shut herself down, and reboot a life that hasn't been hard but she hasn't particularly enjoyed and hasn't brought her anything meaningful.",

It's a tragic, hard book, with this sub-story of a white Englishman who moves to Nigeria and wants to write about the art, and then about the war, and eventually decides it isn't his story to tell.

Still, it got a bit boring toward the end, and I'm not sure I actually got all the way through; or maybe I did, but the ending I didn't really take in well. But I'm including it because I did read the first 3/4 or so quite deeply.\n\nThe book is about why only humans have language, and how recent advances in evolution research has a bit to say about it. (Though a lot is still inconclusive.) One of our major gripes about the book was that it wasn't easy to tell what was their conjecture or hope, and what was actually backed by research.\n\nStill, it gave me good insight into how evolution works, and how evolution research works. They go into the ideas of slow versus fast evolution, and some population dynamics work that discusses when a trait or gene will end up being passed to the whole species. They go into the differences between human language and what other animals can do, and some neuroscience that is starting to unpack the neural basis of language using these differences.\n\nUnfortunately I am super behind on my book documentation; I actually read this... oh, I don't know, much earlier this year, maybe even last fall. (No, I read the Chen Chen book earlier this year, so this book must have been this year.)

It's basically an inquiry into the turtle programming language, and the educational ideas behind it: that we learn better when the ideas are relevant to some particular goal or interest. Papert talks about his own fascination with gears as a child, and how through that he learned a lot of math -- not because he liked math, but because he was obsessed with gears and thus learned all about ratios and geometry. The turtle programming language is designed to mimic this ability to work on something you care about, and the math kind of slips in naturally.\n\nIt's also more generally about how computers will make this kind of education easier and more accessible. That it isn't about learning to code, but rather being able to play with computer code. It's an entryway to mathematical thinking.\n\nIt really blew my mind, and I'd like to reread it. He ties it into Piaget's theories about learning and childhood development, and though it includes all these silly examples of how the turtle programming language works in practice, which I wasn't that into, it's a truly unique book for its content.\n\nI'm not exactly sure his vision came true. Probably Mitch Resnick and Scratch have made the biggest impact, but it's not clear that many people get taught math that way. I was part of a generation of kids who learned the turtle programming language, but then I met most of these people at MIT. It' snot clear that the general population was exposed to it.",

It had a lot to do with being a woman from a different era, about cooking and make up and clothes and hand bags, and it was modern and feminist but I found it hard to vibe with a lot of the ideals. It idolized New York City, which bothers me, because I like NYC but I'm trying not to fall in love and want to stay there forever; people who are in love with NYC bother me I think because it touches a nerve.\n\nBut the writing is great, and she does know how to make even boring things interesting, and her flavor of essay writing is this nice mix of cultural commentary and personal experience.

We talked about one of its primary themes or questions as Mixed Company, and that the poems are expected to be read by lots of different kinds of people, and they interrogate living in mixed company.\n\nMy favorite poem was certainly 'Matt', in which the speaker narrates a long list of characteristics and experiences with her white boyfriends, all of whom seem to be called Matt, and in doing so paint this amazing caricature of white men, who know they are part of the problem but don't know what to do, that have privilege, that love her but don't seem to really love her, that carry the baggage of slavery, if only implicitly. It's an amazing poem in many ways, not least of which the content, but also her ability to continue to make the poem interesting even though it is three whole pages of uninterrupted text, no line breaks or anything, and somehow it threads along perfectly.\n\nThis is definitely one of Parker's feats: juxtaposition that draws you along. It is perhaps surrealist, but seems to walk that line where it can be surprising but make sense, where it doesn't have the razor edge of randomness that surrealism has. Parker is controlled, she is taking us along for a ride.\n\nI also loved the last poem, and the one about Brooklyn that mimics a prayer, and the one about the white girls getting their hair braided in the hair salon.",

This struck me incredibly strongly, this call saying we never really get over the hard things, even when we have gotten past them.\n\nIt has a series of elegies in prose-poem format I found a bit confusing, and I didn't find the writing to be super strong overall. It might have helped to unpack it at the book club, but I felt always just a little bit lost as to what it was about and I wasn't sure if that was on purpose or was just an artifact of this almost-surrealism style of contemporary writing.\n\nAt the Dartmouth symposium Brian made this comment that most computer-generated poetry must appeal to surrealism to bee understood/appreciated. I've thought about this a lot also with contemporary poetry -- does it require surrealism to appreciate? Or are the juxtaposed images actually making sense at a higher level?\n\nThis book struck me as on the edge of great, but just a little too confusing/slant to hit home.",

I had read it, but I thought I'd get the collection.\n\nI liked it a lot. Rich has written *a lot*, this collection is her work in 1971/72. The first poem, 'Trying to talk to a Man', is amazing. But it's the kind of poetry that deserves a few more reads, and maybe some analysis to help me understand what she was getting at, or at least her context. A lot of it has to do feminism, and roles, and I interpreted 'diving into the wreck' as being about acknowledging history, especially history with tends to exclude you (as a woman, but maybe as another group as well). But the poem also has these elements of almost intergender, loosening of pronouns and under the sea we get fantastical creatures. I need more time with it.",

Mum had recommended it to be AGES ago and it was on the Kindle and I was traveling and looking for something engaging to read. So.\n\nIt *was* really engaging. I sped through it, the story and writing was so easy and interesting and good. It's about a white college student (Jessica) from the northeast visiting Kibera, the largest slum in Africa, to help teach drama at a non-profit. She meets the guy who runs the non-profit (Kennedy) who lives in the slums and is about her age. Although she's meant to stay in a compound outside the slum, she says she wants to stay with him. Although everyone tries to stop this, she does. And then they have this amazing friendship, across just gigantic barriers: he grew up struggling in the slums, just getting screwed over again and again in the system. She's a well-to-do white girl from the US. But they form this bond.\n\nEventually she goes back to school, but helps raise money for the non-profit, and eventually helps Kennedy go to her school for some time. He does a great job getting people in the US to help them start a school for girls. It's just this incredible, heart-warming story of these amazing people doing such good for the world.",

I had never heard of him before, but apparently he's a pretty famous poet this is like his eleventh book or something crazy; he's a bit old. All the other readers were young and, what can I say, hip. Yet he really held his own, because his poems were AMAZING. He read this poem about seeing a 'buy one get one free' sign for coffins and all these great puns around the hilarity of that but ending with how it would have really made his ex-wife laugh but she wasn't there in the car with him, because they're not together anymore. Just amazing.\n\nSo I bought his book! And it was really great, some prose poems, all really beautiful and just normal but with that amazing light that poetry shines on the most normal things. I should read it again, I really enjoyed it. He has this poem about watching his son learning to ride a bike and the neighbor calling the kid a 'pussy' (or something like that) and his son just being so confused and the speaker realizing that now the son is starting to learn about all the shit in the world and also maybe 9/11 had just happened and how everything was changing.",

The first poem is stunning -- about the speaker driving past a hospital and seeing two buff biker guys hugging affectionately. Gay tends a lot to contradiction; the poem is about the unexpectedness of this, but also Gay's discomfort and finding it unexpected, it's tied into how he's driving a car and almost runs a red light because he's distracted, the last line is something like \"all of us / still, and listening, as if we had nothing / to blow up, as if we had nothing to kill.\"\n\nIt's a striking first book. A poem about a shooting from the perspective of the bullet, about an ER doctor who sees all this tragedy but must still sit down to dinner every night, about struggling with his father, about getting pulled over by a cop. Gay is honest about his struggle, but also sees the other side in everything. In the foreword (by Thomas Lux?) Lux describes it as finding both the tenderness and rage in everything.\n\nHe doesn't use formal form but he does have a more formal style than a lot of contemporary poets; his tone is quite formal, though his subject matter is casual.\n\nI picked up a copy of 'catalog of unabashed gratitude' which is his third book, but I want to read 'bringing the shovel down', his second book, first.",

But then I read it, and it was probably the best book of poems I read all year, maybe the best *collection* (like, as a whole) I've read EVER. Lockwood may be my favorite, but Deaf Republic is amazing in a totally different way. It's a book I recommend to people who don't read poetry.\n\nIt's a book of poems, but it has the conceit of a play, with a list of characters and two acts, and there is a loose narrative arc. It's set in an unnamed village that is occupied by soldiers. The characters have Russian-sounding names; Kaminsky is originally from Russia. The first poem of the story is about a couple putting on a puppet show that mocks the soldiers. A deaf boy sits in the front row. But then the soldiers come by and get made -- the deaf boy spits at the commander and the commander shoots the deaf boy dead in the street.\n\nThen the whole town goes deaf.\n\nIt's about the couple -- the woman is pregnant and gives birth -- but also the town and more and more people are taken away. Their deafness is at once protest, but also a kind of ignorance, a way to turn their back on others who need help. To me it didn't have a clear message, there were no clear heros, one man appears a hero but then is happy to shoot a captured soldier dead in the street for some oranges. No one is really good in the story, I get the feeling that there is just no truly good way to be in times of struggle.\n\nThe book is book-ended by two poems that are very similar to each other, which seem to be set in modern USA rather than the village. It's about the terrible things going on the US, and the fact that we keep living our lives, we have to keep living our boring normal lives, and the speaker is so sorry that they can do this, they can \"live happily during the war\".\n\nAside from the conceit of the book, which is outstanding and modern but also timeless and speaks right to me, the poems are also glorious, stray dogs in the street, slim like philosophers, men unable to flip their middle finger at the sky because each man is already a middle finger flipped at the sky, asking god 'why did you allow this?' only to get an echo back: 'why did you allow this?' The whole thing is stunning, gorgeous, there are love poems and funny poems, it is not an altogether sad book, it's a true book.\n\nAnyway, it's amazing. Everyone should read it.",

I really liked her poem 'Acknowledgements', and others that had this great momentum and weirdness to them. Then her book came out, and it's about science and turing tests!\n\nOf course, it's not quite what I expected. She takes the idea of a Turing test to be about immigration -- this idea that immigrants have to prove they're human. There's a set of poems on/about/as the turing test. One of which I loved, about accents, \"I broke that horse myself.\"\n\nIt was a good book, though some of it fell short of what I hoped it mostly was strange and striking. Sometimes she seemed to be getting in the way of herself. There was one poem about going swimming in the winter for her birthday that just very plain and emotional and I loved it a lot, but rarely were the poems that... open or straightforward. She enjoys threading her experiences strangely through other images. Which is great, but sometimes keeps the poems at a distance.\n\nI saw her read at the Greenlight Bookstore, with three other people (Angel and Shira! And a woman who read from her memoir, which was mesmerizing, about her anxiety and looking for a Korean therapist). She was good, and the bookstore was packed, a long line of people to get their book signed.",

(The roots.) I was a bit annoyed at how he described people finding their professions, as if these really singular events happen to put people on their path, which I found a bit trite.\n\nIn the next section it starts to get into environmental activism, and eventually all the characters come together a series of environmental terrorism acts, trying to save the trees.\n\nIn the end I loved it, though it was a bit tricky getting through the roots when it comes into the trunk and branches it's wonderful, and finally the crown and seeds their acts planted. It really engaged me, not just the story but the activism, the importance of nature, which now that the Amazon is burning is even more urgent. It made me want to write the ocean poems more.

I already returned it to the library and fucked up and didn't quote it! shame!)\n\nIt reminded me somewhat of a Kay Ryan poem, in that it was descriptive and controlled, though of course its longer, and with a different musicality than Kay Ryan's poems.\n\nThese poems are slow, about children on a farm, about noticing small things, they are rural, they are picturesque. They are very much not the poems of contemporary poetry; they seem to look back more than they look forward, they don't seemed concerned with the identity of the speakers, they aren't political or galvanizing, they aren't about pain or how we live with pain and horror.\n\nI liked them for this, though perhaps they also white, because perhaps whiteness is where you can write like this.

Ideally all in one. This woman is gutsy, she writes about her son's erection, about her parents having sex, about being in her father's balls (as semen, is the idea). Nothing is off limits.

People loved this book.\n\nFirst off, the book itself: a bit skinny for me! But the cover is amazing.\n\nThe reading: He sounded different than I expected. I got my book signed and told him so, and I felt a bit bad immediately after because he was like, \"oh, I hope in a good way.\" Honestly I'm not sure which way. He reading was almost like an intense whisper, and he finished his poem with this kind of articulation that... like sending the ending off into the ether. It didn't trail out, but it didn't hit the hard end like maybe I expected.\n\nThe poems are mostly stunning, pretty narrative and matter of fact, he likes to capitalize the first word in every line, he tends to stick to one-ish-page poems with no stanzas. He also introduces the Duplex, a form with couplets in which that the last words of two lines (split across the couplet) are the same. As a form it didn't do much for me, I would prefer something with a more sonic oomph than repetition, but others seem to really like it.\n\nBrown reminds me a bit of Ross Gay in his content: the tenderness and rage of the black experience, looking down the gun of everything beautiful and terrible about his life. Call me self-centered, the ending of the poem 'Good White People': \"All is stained. She was ugly. / I'm ugly. You're ugly too. / No such thing as good white people.\"\n\nThe first poem of the book is haunting, and generally I liked the poems towards the beginning more than the end, though writing this is making feel, similar to writing about Night Sky with Exit Wounds, that I really need to read this book again, and again.

The networks stuff just wasn't as ground-breaking.

She has this amazing poem about a woman smuggling children out of the ghettos (in Germany?), and how she never got to see the children she saved; she was caught and murdered by the state.

                    "notes": "I had been thinking of reading this book for a while; I saw it around, I like Michael Pollan, I like learning about acid. I read it eventually when Brad gave me his hardcover copy. I liked it; it starts with very classic Pollan digging into the history and biology of mushrooms and the natural hallucinogens, getting into the politics and chemistry of acid and the summer of love and the regulation and the studies. Pollan is very interested in the studies, the science of it all, and seems to need to force himself to be interested in the experience itself, eventually having three guided psychedelic experiences all of which were quite profound but also quite boring. He seems fascinated (or perhaps puzzled) by the profound/boring dichotomy, trying to describe how it could be that feeling like we just need to love more and see more beauty could not be trite or stilted.\n\nIt was a nice addition to my knowledge of the history of psychedelics, which I guess comes mostly from Acid Dreams (which I think I read while staying with Oscar's family one summer, I think it was on his bookshelf) though I feel like I've read more than just that.\n\nMy complaint about the book is that Pollan is intensely focused on therapeutic benefits, and the profound experience. But lots and lots and lots of people use these drugs recreationally, with few profound experiences and instead just having a good time. He doesn't have much to say about that, other than context/suggestability are important for these drugs. (Interestingly, the experience of birthing/being birthed while tripping comes up several times with people he interviews; later it occurs in his own trip.) Even the scientific studies are rife with people just having a plain-old high, so even when people are trying to induce a profound experience it doesn't always come. He doesn't get into why, or talk to people who found it mundane. It's a curious omission -- maybe it's boring to talk about, but it seems important if we really want to understand these drugs.",

Still, I bought a copy from Book Culture and read it.\n\nIt's two long essays, one written as a letter to his nephew focusing on growing up in Harlem and his experience as a preacher, the second about the Nation of Islam and meeting Elijah Muhammed; though I got mixed up as to what exactly happens when.\n\nToday in poetry class with Angel this book came up as an influence on Patrick Rosal; he talked about reading and rereading The Fire Next Time and this giving him an ethical/philosophical framework for considering violence/love.\n\nBaldwin talks a lot about the realities of racism, of being black, and how you learn from a very young age that it is a problem, that behind your parents discipline is a larger authoritarian force they are trying to protect you from. And yet Baldwin doesn't go on to hate white people; this is in fact his problem with the Nation of Islam, that they demonize white people. Baldwin was a preacher before he left religion, and he too found in the church a problematic or misguided disgust in those who are not saved. He wants to be moral to everyone.\n\nHe talks about not hating white people but disrespecting them, seeing the way they treat black people as something to pity, as some fault of their own that they cannot treat others well, that he would (maybe?) rather be mistreated than be the mistreater. (Mistreat is probably too kind a word, but there is no one thing that racism does to people.)\n\nAs Rosal hints at, it is a book that is worth another read. It is short, certainly I could do so.\n\nThere are so many books to reread! And so many new ones to read. It's unclear how it all moves forward.\n\nOh, I almost forgot. The title comes from a prophecy, \"re-created from the Bible in song by a slave, is upon us: God gave Noah the rainbow sign, No more water, the fire next time!\"",

But then I stayed over with Rachel once and really started it, and she said I could borrow it. I proceeded to finish it in the next two days. It shook me!\n\nIt's a book about sex, with a click-baity tagline about the \"new science about sex\". But it wasn't a click-baity book. Instead, it's a book that outlines all the fucked up things we're told about sexuality, especially women's sexuality, and how it's mostly wrong. How we tend to think and be taught (even though we now know it's not true) that women's sexuality is \"men's sexuality lite\".\n\nNagoski starts at anatomy, and moves us into responsive v spontaneous desire, nonconcordance, the idea that desire has both accelerators AND breaks, all lined with stories of people which sometimes made me want to cry they felt so similar to myself. I always felt like if only I could get over some fucked up cultural programming, I too could want sex as often as my male partners. That to be truly sexually free, one must love sex. Embedded in this is the idea that a high libido is the good and natural thing. But this book lines out the idea that maybe I just don't have high spontaneous desire, and that this doesn't mean I can't have a lot of sex -- it just means my desire to have sex has to be stoked and blown on carefully like a small fire, and that I need to take care to not hit my breaks. But it also reminded me that I don't have to have a lot of sex, that I'm not somehow fucked up for being less interested.\n\nShe also gets into orgasm, helping me understand that simultaneous orgasm during penetration is not the end-all of sexual satisfaction. I knew this, but I remember Tom countering me, asking why, if I could achieve this, I would not want to. I tried to articulate that maybe it's not the Best Thing Ever, but I couldn't really explain why. But I think Nagoski gave me the language to say not all orgasms are equal, and not all orgasms are even that good. There is nothing uniquely pleasurable about simultaneous-penetrative orgasms, in fact I could argue that simultaneous orgasms are less pleasurable because of the divided focus, and penetrative orgasms may be less pleasurable overall depending on the person. I think it was hard to discuss because people like Oscar and Tom came from this place of \"I want YOU to enjoy this great thing\" but in reality they had an idea of what I SHOULD enjoy, rather than really trying to learn what I DID enjoy. Tom thinks xyz is the most pleasurable thing for his partners; his partners should get THAT, regardless of their truth.\n\nAnyway, this book blew my mind, and explained and normalized so many of my experiences. She keeps coming back to her refrain: you are normal, you are not broken. I didn't realize how much I needed that.",

Odes is new, 2012, and typical Sharon Olds she gets into the body and aging and her aging body, and she gets into the parts of men she loves (like, balls and five-a-clock shadow) though divorced she doesn't really get them anymore.\n\nI'm looking at the cover now, and it won a Pulitzer Prize. I'm not sure I'd call it her best work, but maybe I haven't sat with it enough. It has this bright white cover with just Odes big and black on the front with Sharon Olds beneath it. It's striking. I honestly didn't realize it would all be about body parts and sex: Ode to the Hymen, Clitoris, Penis, Broken Loyalty, Buttermilk, Wattles, My Fat.\n\nMy favorites were Ode to My Withered Breasts, San Francisco Bay Dawn Ode, Ode to Stretch Marks:\n\nBut then\nI always liked old ladies, I had never\nmet one who looked as if she wanted\nto beat me up.

The aging thing makes sense; in the newness of the old body there is more to say, more to experience. But it's not just that. San Francisco Bay Dawn Ode is about wanting to protect her mother from her mother's mother, coming out of the reeds of the ovary and sinking back into them when she was done. This is an old topic for her, and yet someone it remains brilliant.\n\nShe also has new takes.

                    "notes": "I picked this up from Erica's place in Essex, from a box of books she was giving away. I've met Sven before; he came to the Master Personal Narrative Class I took at GrubStreet as a guest lecturer to talk about personal essays but also to talk about being the editor of AGNI. We read his essay, I think it was called 'The Lint of the Matter', which was mostly about being sad about technology replacing older, physical things. I didn't quite dig it, probably because I'm a technologist and find the random lament of the past obnoxious. But I think I enjoyed it, even if I found it obnoxious.\n\nAnyway, I picked up this book because I thought it might have to do with Electric Literature! I thought it would be interesting to hear from Birkerts on this matter. But actually 'the electric life' is (just?) the poetic life, and the book is a collection of essays Birkerts has written on contemporary poetry, many of which I assume he wrote on assignment or for a magazine.\n\nIt's a bit of a tome, and it wasn't clear I would like it, but in fact I did. I would read it before I went to work in the morning, getting up around 7:30am and heading down to the kitchen where I'd make tea and toast and eat that slowly while making my way through this book. It was peaceful. The essays are not incredibly engaging, yet I enjoyed their slow plod through poetry, I loved Birkerts very practical take, that he was there to understand the delight as a reader, not as a scholar. I loved the way he loved poetry.\n\nTo be honest I didn't finish it, I think mostly because my morning routine changed and the move back to NY and it was just disrupted. Because it was essays, and I got so much out of it the 3/4 I did read, I didn't feel the need to go back and complete it. Maybe I will later. I expect I'll dip back into it if (when?) I try to write a review of my own.\n\nWhich I would like to do. It's a way to engage in poetry and writing without the high bar of poetry, it's a way to get published and read, and it's a way for me to study deeply poetry by forcing myself to articulate what I enjoy. Both Angel and Kaveh said that good poetry reviews are rare, and that not enough people write them. Yet I haven't, yet. Partially because many journals are looking for reviews of specific, new books that I haven't read. (And I have so much to read!) But also because... life. Work.",

                    "notes": "I got this book when I attended the art exhibit portion of the Creativity and Cognition science conference in San Diego in... June? July? Jhave had an exhibit in which continually generated poetry was scrolling down a projector screen, and we were to come up and read from it into a microphone. But the text was going a bit too fast to read it all, so you had to skip around. He described is as \"skiing down a mountain\", where the text was the mountain and the words you spoke was the path you chose.\n\nThen we got to talking and he gave me a copy of his book, even though he only had a few and I don't think they were for sale. It was incredibly kind. I didn't get around to reading it for a couple of months.\n\nBut finally I did. The conceit of the book, or rather of his project, is that every day he would wake up and for two hours edit the output of a poetry generation neural network. He did this for a year. He also was continually tweaking the neural network.\n\nThe conceit of this BOOK, is a curated selection of the poems he wrote, or rewrote, along with some of the raw output of the network, and eight essays (by eight people) of criticism or comment.\n\nSo let's start with the poems. They are generally sparse things, heavy imagery that floats into surrealism. \"Often / I set / The landscape behind bards / I think it.\" They touch at meaning, but the touch tends to be light, short-lived. But they are also controlled. I feel I can tell they are edited by a human -- they do have a thrust, there are connections. They feel like the combination: the strange know-nothingness of the computer that create a beautiful turn of phrase but cannot hold a thought, and the controlled intention of a human. They are neither of these. But they are also both.\n\nReading the raw output you can tell that Jhave curated and edited the words to be thematically in line, not changing so much as to draw actual narrative or thoughts but ensuring the thrust or themes could connect. It's hard to describe the exact difference, perhaps I self-justify, but I feel with a large sample I could tell the difference.\n\nThen there were the essays. I now know several of these people! Nick Monfort, Allison Parrish, Kyle Booten, John Cayley. They all had very different angles: Nick talked about it as a performance piece, Kyle talked about the difficult details of the computational work, Allison discussed the temperature setting of the output and its relation to the text and to climate change, John critiques machine learning but appreciates Jhave's approach. Others discuss the sources (\"where did the monkeys come from?\"). Jhave has the last word, discussing the technical details of the project but also projecting this idea that the network is a virtual muse, predicting that it may become mainstream to have these algorithms inspire and propose to writers words and ideas.\n\nThis book is part of this large project -- Jhave is published 12 booksets of all the poetry from the year, a limited edition that will be picked up by art book collectors (I think). I understand least that part, how it works, how it gets attention, how or why he decided to do it. But the activity I understand fully -- it's something I have thought about deeply since starting the phd, this idea of augmenting writers. It is not quite anything I imagined, though at once it's intuitively obvious, a clear and expected idea. (In retrospect.)\n\nHm, what do I have to say about it. I don't love the resulting poetry, it still lacks the full human-ness that I love about poetry, though it's edging in. But that's my particular likes, I think it is good, I appreciate the gesture. Perhaps I'm not sure it's for me, because it lacks that full human-ness, and so in some ways I'm jealous of the idea but in others I know I would never do it. I'm glad Jhave did it. A probe into the dark. But it's still dark.",

Just after I started it I saw on Twitter someone quote from the book, about how even though we mostly live in cities poets will probably always use nature as their imagery. When I got to that part, I too found it striking and profound, though I've been questioning that a bit lately, especially in my ocean poems: are we really talking about nature anymore? Or are we talking about our ideas of nature? How often do I really see or experience the ocean? Not often. So what are my poems about?\n\nThe beginning of the book was pretty straightforward. I enjoyed the section on meter (I have been meaning to read her book JUST on meter and rhythm, called The Rules to the Dance) where she talks about how we don't like metered poetry as much because we don't read it as much. In the past, everyone read metered poetry from a young age, so it literally sounded better than it does now. But it's still important to understand it.\n\nThe sections on tone/diction/metaphor/etc were less interesting, more like a laundry list. But the parts towards the end about where imagery comes from (the nature bit) and revision were really interesting.\n\nThere was more interesting stuff in the imagery section: perhaps a soft critique of the lyrical, image-heavy motion of slam/some contemporary poetry: \"the reader has been lurched, and has laughed -- has been all but whiplashed -- but has gotten nowhere. In the shed electricity of too much imagery the purpose of the ride -- and a sense of arrival -- may be lost\".\n\nOn revision: \"One of the difficult tasks of rewriting is to separate yourself sufficiently from the origins of the poem -- your own personal connections to it.\"\n\nShe says there are two good uses of the workshop: to learn a shared language with which to talk about poems. And then to use that language to learn to talk about poems -- what works and what doesn't. The goal is not to settle the disputes, but to look \"as closely and neutrally as possible\" to suggest why something does or does not work.\n\nShe also thinks imitative exercises are great -- every other art form uses this to practice, musicians, painters, they all learn to work in someone else's style before developing their own. Why do poets not regularly have to write in a specific style or form? She says the writing is normally bad, because it's on demand, but that's okay. You learn a lot, one of the things you learn is that there are other ways to write than the way you normally write!\n\nBut of course there are the social problems of a workshop: people want to be nice, people want to impress. She prefers ambitious but rough work, rather than something tame.\n\nShe ends the revision section by saying that eventually the writer will go out on their own, and not need (or want?) the workshop or the feedback or the handbook. Because ultimately writing is done alone.\n\nThis is a nice, short book. It was a quick read, but will make a good reference.",

Some great poems from this collection are The Connoisseusse of Slugs, Sex Without Love, The Death of Marilyn Monroe. Olds has the amazing ability of making the old new again and again. Which is why she can write on essentially the same topics (her parents, sex, her children) and it never gets boring. In The Connoisseusse of Slugs we get this vision of an erection as a fragile, eager, trusting thing. Which of course it is! And yet it's always an image of power and strength. She does this over and over again. I saw it especially when I read Odes, because I'd already seen so much of her work and yet Odes did not disappoint or feel redundant. She is a lesson in good repetition.\n\nThis book is also, like most of her books, more of an anthology than a project.

It turns out it's by Richard Powers, and I had just read The Overstory over the summer so I was excited to read more by him. This was published in 1995.\n\nI found it incredibly endearing and an easy read, though I had problems with it. It's about a novelist (name: Richard Powers) who has just ended a long relationship with a woman and goes back to his alma mater, where he was in grad school, as a 'visiting humanist' in a new Center for Science. The Center for Science is very exciting -- with this new thing called the internet, and a lot of research and buzz about artificial intelligence. Powers feels lonely and sad and out of place. He's finishing up edits on his most recent novel, which is depressing as fuck, probably because his relationship was falling apart.\n\nBut he makes some friends with the scientists, and eventually gets roped into a bet and project, trying to create an AI that could comment on literature and pass an English PhD -style candidacy exam. They want to take the list of books HE had to know all about for his PhD, and make the AI comment on that. So he partners up with a crazy scientist to do so, others think it's impossible, and at the end there will be a Turing Test.\n\nThe AI part is just incredibly accurate (though obviously fantastical eventually) and endearing. The writing about the neural networks and internet hold up even though this was written over 20 years ago. (Have we had no new good ideas?)\n\nThey do end up creating something very good, an algorithm distributed across multiple supercomputers that asks what its sex and race are, that only answers to Richard's voice, that is disembodied and therefore, they worry, will never learn properly (don't we know what things MEAN because we have experiences outside of language? the AI only has language). Richard becomes endeared with the thing, which he names Helen, treating it/her like a real being. (Lenz: it's just an associating machine, it's just responding with something plausible, you're reading too much into it. Richard: well, isn't that just what we are? what we are doing?)\n\nRichard also slowly falls into love with a young female grad student as the university. We also get flashbacks to his relationship. He views his (ex) girlfriend as beautiful but also mythical -- that's what I didn't like about the book. His weird view of women as something un-understandable and contrary and confused and beautiful maybe because of it. He writes his books kind of for his girlfriend, though she was also a writer. It just feels very shitty and patriarchal -- he's not cruel, he's just not treating her like a real person, he's treating her like an idea. But also his description of her makes her into a confused fool. It's unclear if the author truly wanted to create a character like that, or if it's meant to be that the narrator could only view her that way. (A lot of the book had that tension -- was the author purposefully doing something? Or was the author also oblivious to the problems?)\n\nAnyway, then he falls in love with a new young grad student that reminds him of his ex, even though he knows it's a trope to do so and he shouldn't pursue her. He does so anyway, roping her into being the human in the Turing Test.\n\nToward the end of the book he shows her the list of canonical works they have been working with. She laughs and says that's not how it works anymore -- there is no one set list everyone has to know, instead people make their own list. And no one just reads old white men, the best work comes from Africa, the Caribbean, diaspora -- he is out of date.\n\nI liked this part, this wrench-in-narrator's-psyche. Richard starts to give Helen news, contemporary stuff, and she gets sad because people are so cruel. Her response to the Turing Test is short, and at the end she says goodbye to Richard, saying it's too hard to get \"dropped in halfway down\" and then she disappears -- i.e. the program stops responding.\n\nIt's an incredibly sweet ending.",

In particular there's one about sound bringing everyone together, about the world being dark but we are all in this together. It's hard to describe.\n\nIt was a hard book to find. I eventually got it from the Columbia Library, but I'd much rather own it so I could return to it again and again. I found another of his books in a thrift store, but I didn't end up getting it. (I got Nature Poem by Tommy Pico instead, even though it was hardly discounted.)\n\nPatrick came to our class, later on after we had talked about his book. He was great, just very down to earth and honest about wanting to be published in the New Yorker, but also not wanting to make his writing or his books more legible just so that more people would like it.\n\nThere was this great poem at the end of the book, a love letter to Melissa Piano, all about pianos and how much history there is in her name.\n\nWhen he visited he read some new work, including a poem called something like 'In a Town Called Sadness' when he had pulled over into a hotel while making a long interstate drive to Texas to look at directions and had seen a man yell out the window to a little girl in the parking lot who was playing a trumpet. It was so beautiful and mystical. His writing is very much romantic. Though Bonesheperds was also about colonialism and violence and trauma. The first poem is about a boy who played piano beautifully, and then murdered another boy in school. So it's about about beauty next violence, violence next to beauty.",

It's actually a trilogy, though I don't think I'll end up finishing it.\n\nThe book is about making contact with an alien civilization, the Trisolaris, who live on a chaotic planet because there are three suns in their solar system, which makes it very hard to predict how long the days will be, and often the planet gets so hot or cold for so long they all have to dehydrate to survive. Still, they have an advanced civilization, and a scientist in China working on a SETI style project figures out she can amplify signals by bouncing them off the sun and ends up getting in contact with them. At first the response is from a low-level sentry -- basically someone who's monitoring SETI stuff on the Trisolaris side, and he says to stop sending messages because the Trisolaris will want come and destroy their (our) civilization because they want a better planet. But the scientist lived through the cultural revolution, her father was killed, and thinks humanity could use some destruction so keeps sending messages.\n\nThis is all revealed in a pretty interesting way, and despite the title I did not guess the three-sun thing about the Trisolaris civilization! The current-time plot has to do with scientists committing suicide for unknown reasons, and the fundamental physics experiments no longer being replicable. This is because the Trisolaris will take 400 years to get to Earth and have sent a proton-sized supercomputer to fuck up the physics such that Earth won't progress and become a stronger civilization.\n\nIt's got a lot of cool ideas. Towards the end it got a little expository, just talking through how the proton-sized supercomputer worked and whatnot. But there was also the cult of people who want Trisolaris to come, which was splitting into those who wanted them to come and destroy humanity, versus those who wanted them to come and just control or reign in humanity. At the end they destroy the pro-Trisolaris cult with atom-thin wires that slice through their ship. But the Trisolaris are still coming, and that's what up with the next books.\n\nIt was unclear what the book was for or against. Was is pro- or anti-science and intellectualism? Was it pro- or anti-humanity? One of the main characters is a wily, off-the-rails policeman who isn't scientific or intellectual, but has great instincts. This compared to the very logical scientist characters. I suspect in the future books it becomes more clear, but those got mixed reviews -- Chad loved them and said they were better, Rob said they were so boring he didn't finish. So I probably won't get to them.",

                    "notes": "I go this book because I saw its book event on the Harvard Bookstore newsletter email and was intrigued, having just read The Electric Life by Sven Birkerts which is also poetry review/criticism. This book said it was about contemporary poets reflecting on the 19th century archive, the so-called American Renaissance of poetry with Emerson, Whitman, Dickinson, etc.\n\nSo I went to the book event, which wasn't well-attended, but wasn't hugely awkward. It was the two editors, who came up with the idea for the book and selected the writers, and three of the writers. Each writer read some of their essay: the first one seemingly just talking about some disease she had (I had no idea how it related to 19th century poetry), the second one reflecting on his obsession with some little known poet (who I had never heard of), and the third one talking about the contrast between Emerson and Tommy Pico's conception of the poet and nature (focusing on Pico's Nature Poem), .\n\nHonestly the first and second were boring, and I almost thought I shouldn't get the book. But I really liked the one about Pico: it was interesting and made the ideas modern. Emerson, and others, had this idea of the poet being God-like, for describing and bringing to life God-like things. The writer reflects on how we would never say that today, claim God-like status as a poet, and maybe for good reason. Pico, an NDN (his term) grappling with the consequences of American settler colonialism, seeing nature not as some idyllic thing but rather as an oppressor, in part BECAUSE Indian's are so often used as metaphors for nature, or being connected to nature.\n\nSo because that last was one interesting, I bought the book and read it mostly in the mornings after I moved into my new apartment in NYC on 143rd St. I finished it during a weekend in Boston. I'm writing this on the bus back to NYC.\n\nIt's a collection of essays, so it's a bit all over the place. The Pico essay WAS really good. The essay about the diseased lady was, actually, about poetry -- Whitman, to be specific -- but it WAS boring, and I skimmed it. (It was also the last one in the book, so I was probably a bit over the whole thing.) The essay about obsession with the little-known-poet (Bard Taylor) ended up being more interesting that I thought -- it was about how our contemporary read of him assumes he is gay, in a society where it's really not acceptable to be gay. But he struggles with this, because it's unclear the poet thought of himself as gay, or wanted to be outed, or viewed as such. We just can't read him as he was, we can only read him as WE are. Which was fascinating.\n\nI liked most of the essays. There was a poem about how Dickinson may have been lyrically or sonically impacted by the black and indigenous servants that passed through/took care of her house. There was one about Moby Dick, from the perspective of indigenous people. The essays were often about the problems with the canon, and how we deal with those problems in our world, which is so different. There were one or two lyric essays that I just couldn't get into.\n\nHowever, it didn't have the neatness of Sven Birkerts detailing what he loved about poems. This was in some ways mostly critique, and harsh critique because the poetry discussed is dead and full of white men and slavery and injustice. So it was critical, but not the critical I've been seeking, which is critical about contemporary work, to help me navigate MY world.",

It's a memoir about a woman growing up in a latino community in New Jersey, and the different accented Spanish of different countries, and parents working in factories and never having enough money, and learning English when she went to school, and eventually forgetting some Spanish or slipping into Spanglish, and then going to college and realizing she was bi, and her mother and aunts being so upset that she's gay, and her becoming a writer, and the whole thing was very beautiful and all over the place and fascinating.\n\nMemoirs are a way to see into another's world, however ever briefly, and Hernandez does this smoothly. She talks of dating a trans man, and her aunts talking to her again, and of being afraid that he's been jumped in a movie theatre bathroom, and whether she should go in and look for him, and then he comes back with popcorn grinning and at ease. She talks of being the only woman of color in a news room and suggesting a story on amnesty or aid for Colombian refugees, only to be told then we'd have to give this to all the other South American refugees.\n\nIt was a bit all over the place -- a bit of this, a bit of that -- which is fine since she had such a fascinating life. But it's wasn't a one-story memoir, and I haven't read many of those. Most memoirs I like have a central thread or tenant; not always an event but maybe a theme. Hernandez managed to keep me reading without this. Or rather, maybe she could have written several memoirs! But put them all in this one.",

I ended up getting it from the Harvard Bookstore, maybe I even ordered it in, perhaps around the end of the summer. That makes sense, because I remember reading it when I saw Alex C. at some point and he asked me about it, I think when him and I and Chris all got dinner before Wordhack. I remember being kind of lukewarm on the book; it was good, with some standout poems, but ultimately not hugely striking, nor hugely oceanic.\n\nI'm not sure how I feel about it now. I mostly remember the star poem for me, Mr. Cass and the Crustaceans, about a teacher she had in school who introduced some wonder about the ocean into her, and how she still thinks of him, and also of death and climate change -- \"How I wish I could tell Mr. Cass / how I've never stopped checking the waters-- / / the ponds, the lakes, the sea. And I worry / that I've yet to see a sperm whale, except when / they beach themselves in coves.\"\n\nIt must have had love poems, though I didn't mark them. I remember the love poems, they reminded me of the love poem by Ada Lim\u00f3n about a love born like a horse ready to love. Those love poems of confidence always strike me, because I want to feel it though I waver, I am always doubtful.\n\nAnyway, this book, I should like to come back to it, the way it trotted its way through oceanic themes, making me reflect on my own attempt at manuscript creation, how important a theme is or isn't. She has a series of poems about people who went over Niagara falls (on purpose). I do love the epigraph of the book-- \"No water, no life. No blue, no green.\" by oceanographer Sylvia Earle.\n\nI think I might enjoy this book more if I'd read some of her other stuff. It's interesting that I might come to like something only in context; though this seems very true in music so why not so in books? This book didn't win me right away. Maybe it needs time, or context, or learning more of her voice to get into it. Or maybe it's just a tad boring! Maybe all can be true?\n\nThere was something I read, probably on twitter, about a review of a book (or movie or something) that said that lovers of the AUTHOR will love the book, but it's not a good place to start and in fact people who don't already love the author will probably hate the book because it's long and winding and keeps getting distracted and is all over the place.\n\nSo there is something to developing a taste for a creator, and loving something because of how it fits into a larger puzzle rather than on its own.\n\nBut in starting out, you have to be different. Because no one loves you yet. Sigh.",

This one is about the Vietnam war, and the collective horror of being an American in Vietnam, in the jungle, with death at every turn. The title is Vietnamese for 'crazy'. It's famous for the last poem, 'Facing It', about looking at the Vietnam War Memorial, which is black and reflective and has the names of all the dead soldiers. It's the last poem in the book.\n\nThe poems are crazy good, sparse and terse on the page, with a couple of outliers (a long prose poem from the perspective of a prisoner-of-war going crazy). They are imagistic and strong strong. One about the soldier who goes first into dug-out tunnels, another about seeing a women ghost while driving along, poems about the moon and about the Buddhist monk who set himself on fire in protest. Komunyakaa was there as a war correspondent, though many of the poems have the feel of being a soldier -- a lot of the poems are from a collective we, and are about the blurring of boundaries and responsibilities in war, especially as a foot soldier.",

I got it at the same time as I got The Handmaid's Tale. It's a short book, and it's blurbed by Toni Morrison saying that Coates is filling the intellectual void left by James Baldwin. Influenced by that, I agree! First of all, the form is similar to The Fire Next Time, which I have read someone recently, in that it's an address to his son. (Baldwin addressed his nephew.) But it also has that almost lyric quality of moving from subject to subject, interspersing personal stories with advice and reflection. It is not quite memoir, and it is certainly not lyric. It is something in between that's hard to describe.\n\nCoates talks a lot about Howard University and his growth there; a lot about race and its construction, its lie and reality. The prose is also just stunning and beautiful, very smooth, like a flowing river of thought, in a way I really like. He talks a lot about his friend Prince, a well-to-do black man he met at Howard who later was shot by a policeman who was trailing him. Toward the end he recounts visiting Prince's mother, who struggled and worked to become a well-known radiologist and give her children everything -- private school education, trips to Europe, a car. But it didn't save Prince from racism. Coates recounts a moment when a white women pushes his son aside, and Coates reacting strongly -- how that was bad, but it showed how always scared he was, how for the white woman it was just a moment, maybe, nothing more, but for him it meant everything, everything that society didn't want to give him, all the disrespect and hatred.",

(He is against symbolic or meaningful tattoos, and wanted me to know that people will always be asking about it.)\n\nBut then my mum wanted to read this collection of essays with Deanna and I, a woman-only book club for Thanksgiving. She got it on the Kindle, so I read it there. I really liked it, mostly the beginning. I think the first essay was about 52 Blue, this blue whale that sang at 52 hertz which is an unusual frequency for a blue whale and made it easy to track. It also made the whale a cultural phenomenon (\"singing to it's own tune\") which actually kind of pissed off some of the scientists. Jamison imagines waxing poetic with the scientist about the whale; instead the scientist doesn't agree to an interview.\n\nThere is another essay about this guy who had an obsessive project about witnessing rural life in Alabama (Mississippi?), and an kind of companion essay about a photographer, Annie, who went back to the same town in Mexico every year for 25 years to photograph the same family. The project is obsessive but also strange; it is witness poverty from the perspective of privilege; Annie is unsure how involved to be, how much to help or witness; the photographs are stunning and real (Annie shot in black and white film, and doesn't compose the scene.) Jamison discusses this idea of composition in photography, and how composed things come out differently.\n\nAnother essay is about a museum of everyday objects that are meaningful because of a breakup. Then the last few essays are about Jamison's love life -- dating, going to her brother's weddings, getting married herself, becoming a step-mother. They were good, but didn't strike me as much as the other ones. I got a bit tired of learning about her; she was interesting but not *that* interesting.",

This book imagines the black man imagined by Susan (something), a woman who drove her two small children into a lake and them claimed that a black man had kidnapped them and driven them away in her car. She was eventually found out (she couldn't pass a lie test) but Eady takes the idea of the man she created -- out of her brutal imagination -- and writes a series of poems about his birth and his life. He is both real and not, he is a creation of others, he represents so many. I think he's called Zero. There is a poem in which he's saying it's good that he exists, because if he exists there's a chance that the children are still alive. He relates himself to the creation of another man who killed his wife (and maybe tried to kill himself) who said that a black man had done it. It's a stunning book with a tragic and grand idea. The other portion of the book is sections from a script (play?) he worked on, and the first part (more explicitly brutal imagination) has a bit of the feel of a play, sometimes with stage directions setting the scene. He is very careful with giving just the right amount of information; it's a lesson in how much context is necessary. Obviously there is a lot of context to the actual story that it's inspired by, but he's good at being minimal with it such that knowing more extends the reading but coming to the book without it doesn't limit it.",

                    "notes": "I read this for the CS PhD book club, because we wanted to read the sequel that had just some out, The Testaments, but most of us hadn't read The Handmaid's Tale either. I thought I had read it, but really couldn't remember anything about it. (I can confirm I read it, because I read it the year I read 100 books which I still have a list of.) Even when reading it this time around, it didn't really come back to me, which is pretty crazy.\n\nAnyway, the book is AMAZING (much better than The Testaments, which I'll talk about later). It's this almost dreamlike recollection of a woman who had become a handmaid in a fascist regime in the US based on Puritan values. Many woman are infertile, so the handmaid's are assigned to wealthy households to get impregnated by the head of house. This is based on some biblical passage about Ruth, who says someone else can get pregnant for her. So the protagonist, who we only know from her official title 'Offred' (as in, 'of Fred', the head of the house), is there to have sex with him but basically nothing else. She had a daughter before the regime who was taken from her.\n\nThe book recounts Offred's experience of bored, of wanting to die, of not being supposed to read, or all her options taken from her. She does get contacted by a revolutionary group, but it's hard to know who to trust. The head of household starts taking her into the office at night, he wants to play scrabble with her and let her read and also kiss her, romantically.\n\nShe starts sleeping with the soldier who lives on their property, at first at the bequest of woman head of house who thinks her husband is infertile (everyone wants to have a baby in the house) but then again out of some unspoken desire, maybe for love or maybe just for something real. They never really talk, at least he doesn't, and the affair is dangerous and unclear.\n\nAt the end Offred gets taken away, but it's unclear if she is being taken away for punishment/as prisoner or if that's a ruse and actually it's the revolutionaries saving her.\n\nThen there is this funny postscript, which people tend not to like, that's an academic conference in the future where they've found the tapes of Offred (presumably) and they're trying to make sense of it historically. They call it The Handmaid's Tale because they don't really know who the handmaid was, and she seems to just be recording her story. They compare Gilead (the US fascist regime) to the fascist regime in Iran and other places. Atwood made it clear that the book didn't envision anything that hadn't taken place somewhere, at some time in history.\n\nThe postscript is fun and interesting, but really the story, it's atmospheric nature, is what was amazing about the book, and likely so inspirational. There are plot points, but they don't always lead to something, and this felt very real. There is also this sense that other women from Offred's past didn't survive the regime because they were too against it, perhaps it was Offred's fear that has allowed her to survive (and hopefully retaliate) but that too is a scary warning. But that perhaps is what made it feel so real; that Offred was not that great, that she was afraid, that she played her part.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI had actually written a post for this previously. Sigh. Below:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI read this for the CS book club. We wanted to read The Handmaid's Tale, and then The Testaments. I swear I had read this book in high school or something, but I think in my memory it got mixed up with another book (can't remember the name) with AIs or something. Anyway, as I read it again I remember NOTHING except the general gist that I might have just gotten from the TV show becoming popular. I got the book from the library, one of the first I picked up from Hamilton Grange which is my new library with the new apartment. Later I bought a used copy from a cool used book store Rachel, Silas and I happened upon when walking through SoHo.\n\nAnyway, I loved it. Well, I found it truly dark and disturbing. Just so so grim. Offred seems to be in a hopeless situation, no way out. She has survived by playing along; that is how all the handmaid's have survived, but you never know if someone is playing along or a true believer, so they don't trust each other, and that makes sense. How could there be any uprising? How could there be any organization? The society is set up to make everyone suspicious, every look down upon each other.\n\nAtwood is amazing at detailing how a society like this would work out. How Offred is so often bored, in a bare room with nothing to do except dream of suicide. When she is invited into the Commander's office, I was SHOCKED when he said he wanted to play scrabble. But I appreciate how Offred was suddenly so cunning, trying to figure out the power dynamic and what she could possibly do with it.\n\nAtwood makes it clear that everything in the book has happened somewhere, at some point. And perhaps that's what is so disturbing -- it is quite close to reality, it is in some way reality for some people.\n\nIt is a book that has aged well, continually relevant for each generation. Over 35 years old! It feels like it could have been written yesterday.\n\nWe had a great discussion about world building, and if Luke was actually a jerk, and fertility decline, and the ending (the academic framing), and if it could happen in the US.",

                    "notes": "Erica recommended Dan Chiasson to me when I said I wanted to read more poetry criticism. This is the only thing I could pick up at the library; it's a slim book, basically a set of 5 essays conjoined by their interrogation of autobiography in poets who don't seem or purport to write autobiographical (or maybe confessional, whatever that means to Chiasson,) poems. He seems to be arguing that these poets *are* autobiographical, even when they don't seem or claim to be.\n\nI found the prose of this book beautiful and tricky to follow. He's a bit all over the place, jumping from poem to poem, from idea to idea, in a way that surely makes sense in the context of being extremely well-read (and maybe in his mind) but was tricky to follow as outsider. To be fair, I have not read that much of the five poets he discusses: I've read a lot of Gl\u00fcck, a decent amount of Bishop, some Lowell, but little to no Bidart or O'Hara. So perhaps the dreamy nature of his prose was more due to my lack of context than any particular writing style.\n\nStill I liked the dreamy quality; Chiasson seems to read a lot into the poems (at one point when discussing a Lowell poem, in which Lowell describes text on the tail of an airplane, Chiasson proclaims that Lowell was clearly talking about the Vietnam war) and this was beautiful, like a poem in its own right.\n\nPerhaps Lowell is the most strictly autobiographical, which was apparently sensational for the time, which considered poetry to be lyric and above (or beyond?) the individual (though they were post-Whitman -- perhaps he was not autobiographical so much as a stand-in for all). There's a sense that Lowell tries to do this also, reflecting on or taking the position of his ancestors, but without the grandiose. Bishop, in contrast, is cagey, hardly biographical, tending toward persona that end up revealing herself -- like a long poem on/from the perspective of Crusoe. Bidart is almost always working with, or against, existing texts; rewriting them, arguing with them; his autobiography lives in others, somewhat like Bishop. Bidart also takes on persona, and these are often writers, like Ellen West, a woman in the hospital due to an eating disorder, they fuse and split. O'Hara's poems are conversational, humorous; he was a curator at the MoMa and often wrote ekphrastically, or else wrote quickly, in down-time between happenings, or wrote poems like paintings. He is compared to abstract expressionists, says he finds jazz too close to writing, he called his poems \"I-do-this, I-do-that\" poems, he doesn't *seem* autobiographical, but Chiasson argues he just throws his autobiography onto the more sturdy site. Louis Gl\u00fcck strays closest to narrative, but also doesn't feel autobiographical; her poetry is intensely personal, but the style is strangely impersonal, sparse and distant. Again, Chiasson finds she comes through most in persona, when the poet and persona must necessarily come together.\n\nAs a whole I liked the book -- I enjoyed reading it, I enjoyed the sentences and their meanings and they strung together. I'm not sure I'll *remember* much, and as inspiration goes I'm not sure I can ever write like this (will I ever know enough about poetry to do so?) but perhaps I can return to it to get a dip into the style, the kind of academic and lush fragrance of reading deeply, connecting deeply into the semantics of a thing.\n\nI would be curious to know what Chiassson thinks of, or reads in, some of the contemporary stuff I've been reading --- Franny Choi, sam sax, etc. etc. the Angel Nafis poets -- whose work tends to be more strictly autobiographical, though for very different reasons, I suspect, to some of that in the cannon. But not all the work is, and I'm curious how he sees the slant of the thing, of the poems that stretch out into something else.",

I went to the launch party with most of the class, and later I bought it, probably at the Strand though maybe from Book Culture. The cover is beautiful, Shira painted/designed it herself, and the project is catchy -- write an ode to lithium every time she had to take lithium in a year (twice a day, so ~750 poems). Apparently originally she had a complex numbering sequence; each poem an ode with a number, out of order, missing some, based on some unspoken logic. But the final version had none of this; instead the book is in titled sections, and the poems tend to be titled.\n\nThe style is all over the place -- couplets, spaced out full page poems, small skinny ones, prose poems. And it's quite long. The poems have a haunting quality to them; they do that thing where they tell a story, but the details and order of the details have a kind of echo, like the first poem, about telling the doctor that the pain in her arms feels like snakes in her skin, and he wants to confirm that she doesn't literally think she has snakes in her skin. The most memorable poems (I don't have the book with me now) tend to be the narrative ones: the one about making up with her mother, or noticing the ad for egg donors and realizing she's not wanted because she has a history of mental illness. Maybe not all, I remember the one about the Buddhist man self-immolating (last poem in the book) and the one about Bjorn in the bathtub (and the surfacing of nipple), or the one about an imagined Phineas Gage.\n\nI worried a bit that I wouldn't like it, that I wouldn't find the poems engaging but I did, almost right from the beginning.",

I had also found a book by Patrick Rosal, but decided I should just get one and I had been meaning to read Nature Poem for a while.\n\nLike Junk, Nature Poem is a book length poem, lots of long lines and double line breaks. Pico is talking about hating nature poems, and kind of hating nature, because of all the baggage associated with Indians and loving nature, like maybe it's especially bad for him to litter because he's an Indian? It's got the colloquial, slang feel of Junk, and the slow build toward a love of nature, just wanting it to be on his own terms, not wanting to have this relationship defined by others.",

Apparently she did four books in a series, each on an element: earth, fire, water, air.\n\nAt first I wasn't that into it. I was like, ah, okay, poetry, very vague, a bit weird, whatever. But the more I read the more I got into the rhythm of her words, and her themes. A lot of poems are about going to congressional hearings, about an anti-war movement, about the reality of the generals making decisions, about water ways and birds of California. I came to enjoy the kind of lullaby of the lyric. There's very little narrative in this book, maybe the narrative is the larger theme of water and humanity and those, who are also water and humanity, who tend to destroy it.\n\nA lot of the poems end with a small black and white photograph. The book has four sections; the third section is a series of lyric poems about the moon, short skinny poems two per page about a month's moon (or once dawn). There are a lot of caesuras, a lot of using the entire space of the page, one poem that is right justified.\n\nIt's interesting: I don't think the poetry is capital G Great, but it's loving and beautiful, it takes a slow stance, it's assertive but not aggressive or sensational. There's nothing wrong with sensation, and poems that draw on that have a strength and flavor that I also love, but there's also something nice about a slow lapping of words over the mind.",

I could not get it at a library *anywhere* (at least not in time for our meeting) and nor could I manage to borrow it from anyone, so I bought it at the Strand before I went up to Cambridge (for Thanksgiving?) and returned it when I went back. (I think I still have some money left over... I used part of it to buy Middlemarch.)\n\nI read it in a rush, an inhale, starting it at Rachel's place right after I got it and finishing it on the bus up to Boston. It was an easy read like that -- writing was good, characters were interesting. It's goes into the details of early Gilead, and ends with some women escaping with a bunch of knowledge about how to bring it down. The chronology of the length of Gilead was a little unclear -- Aunt Lydia was a lawyer when Gilead was formed and she managed to convince the Gilead leadership to let her take control of many of the women. And she is still there to try to bring it down. Which means it couldn't have lasted more than 50 years? Unclear.\n\nMy favorite parts were about the girl growing up in Gilead. This alternate perspective, the child of a rich family, was fascinating compared to the handmaid's perspective. They (the young girls) were told to be chaste, that their flesh attracted and enraged men, and yet still they knew that to be beautiful was important; you'd marry better. There were also many young girls who were abused by either their parents or other authorities (e.g. the dentist) and some of these girls were so petrified of getting married they tried to commit suicide. The leadership had to walk this line between telling the girls to be chaste but not scaring them so much they wouldn't get married or ever have sex. The girls thought that the handmaid's were sluts, because they slept with different men. That psychological portrait was amazing.\n\nSo I loved reading it, but when we discussed we mostly thought it was a bit overdone, the plot was too clean and didn't always make that much sense, it felt a bit too much like tying stuff up. What was great about The Handmaid's Tale was the perspective of Offred, her feelings and ambivalence and small rebellions. There wasn't much plot, or the plot was an arc of activities or emotions, rather than an intricate arrangement of intersecting stories. Atwood didn't convince us with the plot in The Testaments, and instead it veered toward fan fiction, which is to say she did a lot of things to satisfy the reader's curiosity rather than writing a beautiful or thought-provoking novel.",

I think the show works without the context of the book, but the book lends a nice history to it.\n\nI'd been meaning to read Watchmen for a while; it's pretty critically acclaimed. I don't normally like superhero stuff, but this one was meant to be great. And it's not really a superhero story, it's almost an anti-superhero story. In Watchmen, the superhero's are all washed up, and getting murdered, and old, and kind of retelling their fucked up past and over the whole costuming thing. They're in 1980s NYC, an alternate one, crime is high, the cold war is looming, everything looks pretty terrible. There's rape, there's trauma, there's the guy Rorschach who wears a mask with what looks like a Rorschach test on it who seems pretty crazy and paranoid and is super violent obsessed with a very specific view of justice.\n\nToward the middle it got a bit boring; just more flashbacks to not-super-interesting histories of the superheros. But then in the end if came through with a great plot twist, that Veidt (the superhero-turned-businessman) is behind all the killings of the superheroes, with a plan to drop a giant squid on NYC to distract everyone from the cold war.\n\nIt's kind of crazy and clever and really made the book worth it for me.

I also ended up getting a bunch of poetry books that I found on the shelves, and this was one of them. I was struck by the title -- my 'poems on computation' chapbook was called 'Hysterical Light' -- and I read the first poem, about how crazy awesome trees on the street are, and really loved it.\n\nI read the rest of it in bed while Silas was sleeping in on a Sunday in New York -- the first time I went back in January in 2020 after a long time in Cambridge/Somerville. It's pretty short, maybe 60 or 80 pages, and I was also reading a bit of sam sax's 'bury it' book as well (which I didn't finish in the morning).\n\nThe first poem was very strong -- surprising, rhythmic, joyful. The second poem, which I had also read in the library, was strong too, about a boy who's brother died in Vietnam and ran around the block five times when he heard. But the rest of the book was less strong. It's hard to know exactly what that means; lots of the books assigned in Angel's class I didn't dig too much on the first reading, so it's possible this book would be better if I paid it more attention. But I don't really have reason to, so I'll return it tomorrow.\n\nWhat made it not-so-exciting? The topic was ... whatever, her life, musings, observations. I think there was one of climate change, some about being black and proud, some about divorce, about painting (she is also a painter). I guess they just didn't strike me. I might do well to understand why not. There was some playing with space on the page, but not much: mostly mid- to long-lines, sometimes in couplets or tercets, often one or two pages long. (Omg, am I talking about my own work?)\n\nLike, there's this one poem called Fall about how her neighbor hangs a Christmas wreath on their side door, where only she can see it. She's kind of musing about fall (\"Imagine / if instead of leaves, the sky fell\") and how her neighbor doesn't have guests, it isn't for anyone. How she fell once getting to home in heels and how whenever you fall like that you want your mother or someone to help you and she imagines ripping the wreath apart. I dunno, this poem just didn't do anything for me. It wasn't rhythmically or aurally interesting, the subject matter was whatever, it didn't seem to continue a theme or play with a particularly interesting idea, it jumped from place to place mildly. It was just... boring.\n\nMaybe because the first quarter or so of the book didn't strike me it was hard for the rest of it too. But then, Practical Water grew on me. Perhaps because it had a stronger stylistic element; this book had that kind of talking tone so when it didn't capture me there was nothing to build? But I suppose if her talking tone had been more distinctive or interesting... Hm hm hm.",

I read it a while ago (I'm always late writing this) but I just read/wrote about Ridiculous Light, which I randomly picked up at the library and which didn't do much for me. What's the difference? They both have a conversational tone. And Olds rarely does this themed/project book. But I guess Olds has this really unique and interesting way of looking at things. Like the first poem in this collection I marked is called Last Look and it's about the last time she looks in her husband's eyes as they file divorce. And it's a stunning, shattering poem about seeing him for the last time (and him letting her see him), describing his eyes like the early ocean, and then saying goodbye and leaving and being disoriented by that but still feeling, years later, that she was glad to have looked at him, and in the end talking about how grateful she was to no lose him when they were young, or when the kids were young, and at the end she says how she's grateful not to have lost someone who could have loved her for life.\n\nLike, DAMN. The poem goes through this whole intense moment and then reflection on the moment that builds and builds -- this poem has a whole host of ideas and feelings in it that build on each other. Plus the sensational imagery that brings its own emotional tenor -- the imagery doesn't just help describe the thing (or describe it beautifully) but helps describe the feeling of the thing.

Maybe the best play ever? Certainly the most unexpected.\n\nThe first act seems like a normal family drama of a well-to-do Black family. Mother's birthday, everything must be perfect, the daughter wants to take a gap year. Ends with the main character, the mother, fainting because the cake is burning.\n\nThe second act is the first act redone in silence, while four people have a cringe-worthy conversation about race over the top of it; they all seem white: there's the liberal woman, the bro, the gay man, and a European women. The bro poses the question 'if you could be any race you wanted, which would you be?'. It seems at some point like they are watching the family drama maybe on TV. The bro gets into this crazy monologue talking about he knows his life is like a TV drama and everyone's rooting against him which is fine... it just goes really crazy and violent.\n\nThe third act is a continuation of the second but the four people speaking over the action start to enter the scene as characters in the Black family. They are play-acting being Black, but it's also clear they are their own characters, and they talk to each other like normal. Only the daughter of the family seems to know something is up, and she is distressed. The white people keep acting like the Black family must be poor; the Black family keep being like -- I wasn't a maid, we are all college educated. The white characters introduce plot twists: the daughter is pregnant, the mother has cancer, the father gambled away the mortgage. Things again go crazy, a crazy food fight and dancing where they wreck the place.\n\nFinally the daughter of the family takes control, eventually giving a monologue to the audience where she asks the white members of the audience to go on stage to see what it's like to be watched. She gives the remaining monologue to her \"colorful people\" still in the audience.\n\nI bought the play as a book because it was so stunning to watch and to reread it I got a lot out of it again; I saw some parallels that happen early on about watching -- the first line is the wife scolding the husband for sneaking up on her and watching her while she fixes herself in the mirror. And the dialogue in act two was just as stunning and cringe-worthy as the first time.\n\nIt's weird because it's implicitly attacking me, or rather saying, Stop looking so hard at us! Yet I wanted to go back to the play... I guess it's kind of mesmerizing, the way the playwright personifies everyone, mostly the white group, the way they are caught up, in totally different ways, with race and stereotypes. Maybe I like it because it's like looking into a distorted mirror, and I hope that if I look and look I'll see something about myself that I couldn't see otherwise.",

Still, I saw something in it, maybe more than in Ridiculous Light (though it's hard to tell how much preconception affected that). I don't want to demean it, but a good description is a kind of depressing, liberal view of the world from a particular identity. I guess maybe the identity precedes him; not sure how much I would pick up from the book alone. Definitely gay, maybe would get white. There's a poem about Ferguson, a poem about picking his brother up from jail (and the general ease of this compared to if he had been Black), poems about gay suicide. I guess I'm saying it's pretty rooted in an identity. Comparing again to Ridiculous Light, RL's speaker had identity, and yet it didn't feel like the book was rooted in that; those were the circumstances, not the ethos. Maybe that's not correct. Maybe RL was just happier?\n\nAnyway, the first few poems are great. Opens with a poem about a man fishing who catches boy 'after boy, / after boy, / after boy,' and the second poem is about not wanting to be born \"anything horrible / as a man.\" and his older brother (young then) holding the speaker in his arms, saying that it looks like a monster and they should bury it. (It's nice to get the title so soon; helps make concrete the tone or conceit of the book.)\n\nThere was a poem about water -- about the ocean, really, and all our beautiful metaphors for it/from it, yet when people drown the ocean is not beautiful at all.\n\nThere is a long poem about a friend who died.\n\nI liked the book as a whole. It didn't strike me particularly, but it had a consistent tone and a heartful slant. The poems tend to be spacious: short lines, double line breaks or short stanzas. But they vary in how they look -- some spread across the page, some prose poems, some of those square looking poems with lost of slashes. Is the variety good? I think it helps alleviate the poems not being as good? (Not saying these poems weren't good...) but if you're not going to play with form much then your content has to be aces.",

This is compared to an idea that we just generally have better mental abilities than other animals, and it is this \"betterness\" that gives us language.\n\nI'm pretty convinced by his arguments that language seems different to general cognitive abilities. Other animals have better kinds of cognitive abilities; some can memorize sequences better, or vocalize better, etc. But even when we work really hard to give certain monkeys language, they don't seem to compose the words in the meaningful ways we do.\n\nThere were a lot of examples from different language to show these \"rules\" of language, like no language ever does xyz. I found that part to be kind of boring.\n\nThere was a cute takedown of \"bot language\", which talked a bit about a CS research experiment where they had bots learn to negotiate based on transcripts from an MTurk study, and that when they used a reinforcement learning framework the bots started to diverge from english into a weird language that involved a lot of repetition. This was actually kind of interesting and I hadn't seen it before.\n\nIn the end he explains 'merge', which is another Chomskian hypothesis that the basis of all language is a merge operation (hence the tree structure as opposed to linear structure of language). We weren't really convinced of merge. There were a couple problems that seemed to be dealt with in silly ways. Like in order to make it work you have to sometimes have a repeated word in the merge process and one of those words ends up not being vocalized. e.g. when you say \"Who did it belong to?\" you need to put the \"who\" with the \"belong to\" and there's no tree structure to get it all the way to the right correctly. So they say, well really it's \"who did it belong to who?\" and you don't say the last who. Which is... weird and kind of an ad hoc work around.\n\nThe alternate hypothesis is basically that we just hear patterns and learn to use those patterns; i.e. there's no strict underlying structure, it's just what we're exposed to. The problem with that is children will spontaneously create language even if they're not exposed to it (e.g. some deaf kids). But the pattern-learning has it's pros; like it deals well with all the anomalies that merge has to deal with. So in our discussion we thought it would probably a bit of a language machine in the brain coupled with good pattern learning.\n\nThere was a piece at the end up how language is changing, giving examples of immigrant kids in London who speak their parents' language at home and English only with each other, with minimal examples (because they don't speak English at home). It was cool, but again it seemed hard to see how the linguists decided what was rigid and what wasn't when things change like that. Like, language simultaneously feels (as a... user of language) that there are super clear rules and also that those rules change often. I have this strong intuition for what is right, and yet I'm also so open to that being changed. (e.g. now the use of \"like\" is kind of like a hedge; it's a way to soften what I say, or the use of \"thing\" as \"phenomenon\"; I guess those are both more about word meaning than syntax, but still.)\n\nAnyway, it was good, a bit of a slog in the middle but overall a fun read and it did do a better job of explaining merge to me.",

And then she figured out to write about her father, and suddenly her skill had a subject worthy of it. I hadn't known that her father died when she was quite young, so a lot of her poems are imagined figures of her father. I also didn't know she wasn't Jewish.\n\nTeicher also talked about some poets that didn't improve greatly after their initial success, and ones that did continue to improve throughout their whole career.

Brad had read her second book (or first? I can't remember which is which) called Normal People and really liked it, and Rob had read it on recommendation (he was gonna wait to see if it was still so popular after the hype died down, but then read it anyway on this recommendation) and really liked it. So it was in my periphery and Brad got it for me for Christmas.\n\nIt's meant to be a millenial book -- about, by, maybe for -- and when I started it I was a little annoyed at that description. The main character (oh no what's the name...) is so... unable to be sincere and kind of obnoxious that I didn't want to be associated. It's set in Dublin, the summer, the main character is performing slam with her ex-girlfriend and the duo is being profiled by an older writer/photographer who invites them over to her fancy place after a poetry event. Okay, I looked up the names: main character is Frances, ex-girlfriend is Bobbi, older (only slightly! 30s!) is Melissa, and her husband is Nick. So the story revolves around this quad and their various relationships -- Bobbi is in love with Melissa, Frances starts an affair with Nick, eventually Frances and Bobbi kind of get back together. Frances is so unable to be sincere with Nick, she kind of holds her affection in disdain and sarcasm. The 'happy ending' is her telling Nick she would like him to come see her. That's her big move of honesty.\n\nI read it all in one breath over Christmas day and I fell in love with. The characters, to me, were mesmerizing. I started out disliking them, but came to think maybe I had more in common with them than I thought -- that maybe I too sometimes fell into sarcasm as a way to not have to deal with sincerity. I liked it so much I got Laura to read it, and we had a mini book club at her house with her friend Rob. (Sara was meant to come but she was trying to finish her thesis.) Neither Laura or Rob liked it. They thought the writing was bad, that the characters were thin. Laura thought it was the kind of novel she would have loved when she was in college, she would have been jealous of Sally Rooney for the novel. I'm not sure I loved it in that way. I think I'm a bit jealous, but not really, I'm not trying to write fiction right now. What I liked about the novel was how well she described this character that couldn't see much about herself. It's arguable whether or not Rooney could see the truth about her characters, maybe not as much as some readers, but I suppose that's ok. (In an interview she talked a bit about this, writing characters who are just beyond her own understanding.)\n\nI get that the characters are obnoxious, young, self-centered. I'm not sure they were flat. There was this undertone of privilege and liberalism, Frances is kind of anti-capitalist but doesn't really do anything about it. (She doesn't do much of anything of her own accord, really.) There's a constant hypocrisy of all these wealthy people discussing the politics that they are kind of immune from. Bobbi is a militant lesbian, but comes from money. Frances doesn't -- when her father, a drunk, stops sending her money she can barely buy herself food. (So, she comes from a bit of money, just not as much.) It was obnoxious but at least... honest. It didn't try to sidestep how these young women were supported, or pretend that they weren't, even if it couldn't grapple that well with those issues.\n\nAnyway, overall I really loved the book, despite it being a bit trashy and the characters mostly being garbage. I guess it was beautiful garbage.",

I just found it on the shelf and thought, yeah, I should read more cummings. It's an anthology, grouped into chapters by themes in his poetry. It was nice in that each chapter began with a description of the poems. Like, these poems are portraitures, and here are some of the people he described and why they were important. Or, these were the love poems, or concrete poems, etc. Apparently he wrote a ton about prostitutes in France, was kind of thrilled by sex though he was somewhat repressed also? He grew up in Cambridge, pretty privileged, was in France for the war (but didn't serve? I forget), but came back and was basically a successful poet his whole life. Women loved his love poems but he preferred his weird, concrete poems that tried to follow cubism and abstraction from the painting world.\n\nI think I also preferred his more abstract work, poems that can hardly be read because their play is all in the placement on the page. They were interesting and strange and evocative. I also liked his more rhythmic work, the sing-songy almost nursery-rhythm poems. But even so, the ones I liked most where the ones I had seen before; the famous, anthologized ones. I thought I would find news poems of his I liked, but I didn't.\n\nI found the rest of his work a bit bland, just not doing anything for me. Maybe I didn't give it enough time, or maybe the style of the era isn't one I'm used to or comfortable with. Or maybe it really was his best work that was anthologized.",

I picked it up for $8 from the Strand, a lightweight paperback copy, at least as lightweight as one can get for an 800 page novel.\n\nI put myself on a reading schedule: 50 pages a day, which I mostly adhered to so I finished it in a little over two weeks. It's not always a page-turner but rarely did I struggle to do 50 pages, and occasionally when I was getting tired of it something very exciting would happen and I would be pulled back in.\n\nThe book is about a whole network of people who live in a small town, Middlemarch, in England in the... 1840s? Shortly before The Reform, which was this big move to give more people rights in terms of voting. The characters are Dorothea and her younger sister Celia and their uncle Brooke; Mr Casaubon (who Dorothea marries) and his cousin Will Ladislaw (Dorothea first marries Casaubon, who is much older than her; he dies in about a year and then there is a delicious plot around her getting with Ladislaw); Sir James Chettam (who Celia marries); Lydgate; Fred and Rosamond Vincy (Rosamond marries Lydgate); Mary Garth and her parents and various younger siblings (Mary marries Fred); Farebrother (no marriage for him, poor guy); and Bulstrode (who turns out to ... have somehow taken the inheritance of Ladislaw).\n\nSo, a lot! The plot is tasty, almost soap opera esque. But the real charm is in Eliot's portraits of the characters and their strengths and flaws, and her writing of how people misunderstand each other, especially when they are trying to communicate, and the perils of marriage. She has a great philosophical bent, which is hard to imagine in contemporary literature but she pulls off with flying colors. I really loved it.\n\nI did a good job of marking in my copy parts I really loved; like the analogy of looking into a piece of polished metal and seeing all the scratches in a circle, when really the scratches are in all directions and it's the light that only illuminates the circular ones -- this is how we see the world, just as our light hits it and not in all its randomness. Or her description of how Lydgate learns to treat Rosamond as a pitiful animal who cannot control her emotions, but also in this act subjugates himself to her. I loved when Dorothea and Ladislaw talk--they are both trying to say they love the other, but they both hear the exact opposite.\n\n&nbsp;",

But I didn't want to buy it hardback, and other things kept coming up, so eventually I requested it from the NYPL. It had hundreds of holds on it, though, so I wasn't sure how long it would take. I got it around the time a couple other books I had requested came in -- How to be an Anti-Racist, The White Album, neither of which I managed to finish before I had to return it.\n\nHowever, I did finish On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous. Its conceit, loosely, is a son writing a letter to his mother, who won't read it because she doesn't speak much English (and maybe is illiterate?) It starts with these vignettes about how she hit him, but that she was so traumatized by the Vietnamese war that this abuse is... understandable, or doesn't turn the son against the mother.\n\nThe start of the book is mostly about the story of the mother, and the grandmother. The grandmother runs away from her home (and an arranged marriage?) and becomes a prostitute in the city. She marries a white man and has a child (the narrator's mother) but likely the father is not the husband. The narrator's mother is ostracized in Vietnam for being white, and at some point (this was not clear to me) immigrates to America with the grandmother and the (through marriage) grandfather. The mother is married to an abusive man who she eventually leaves. She works in a nail salon. There is a story about American soldiers eating the brain of a monkey in Vietnam.\n\nBut then it turns to being about the son's relationship with Trevor, a boy he meets while working on tobacco farm. Trevor is white, also abused by his father but with less story to understand why or to love the father through this abuse. They're both poor, and Trevor especially doesn't like to acknowledge that he's gay, e.g. not wanting to bottom. But though the relationship is marked by poverty and homophobia and masculinity, Trevor is also tender, and the narrator makes a point of noting his love of sunflowers and how he wouldn't eat lamb after he learned it was baby cow.\n\nThere is a final topical turn in the book toward the opioid epidemic. We learn that the narrator is now a poet living in NYC and many of his friends from Hartford (where he grew up) are addicted to opioids, including Trevor. Eventually Trevor dies of an overdose, and the narrator returns home for the funeral.\n\nAt some point the grandmother also dies, and there's the death in the USS but also a funeral in Vietnam. The narrator wanders outside at night to find drag queens mourning someone who died during the night. Though drag queens are ostracized, if someone dies in the night it's important for people to mourn, so the drag queens are hired to come out and perform. It was a really weird and interesting scene about the clash of cultural ideas and how those who are ostracized are also incorporated. Or something.",

It's a short read, and follows a number of different characters getting different jobs at The Factory, which is this big corporation in a town that has a sprawling campus and hires most of the town and is also considered decently prestigious. Also it seems like the economy is pretty bad so people are feeling lucky to get jobs.\n\nOne of the characters gets a shitty, low-level job of shredding papers. Another is copy-editing very random documents and it's unclear if anyone ever looks at their edits. Another is a PhD student pulled from academia to study moss on the factory's campus, with an unlimited budget and no real timeline or goal.\n\nIt swaps between these stories (and maybe one more?) with a kind of randomness, the characters sometimes meet or somehow intersect but never with a kind of narrative arc. As the book gets towards the end you start to learn about these animals that seem unique to the factory, the specific birds that live nr the harbor in the factory ducts or outlets and these lizard-like creatures that live in the laundry units. Here we start to see the characters intersect more -- a young kid gives the moss scientist and report on the creatures, the editor edits it, the shredder maybe shreds it.\n\nIt ends in a weird way, maybe that some of the works turn into the birds? I forget. It's a surrealist ending that is not the result of any larger arc that I noticed. The novel is more of a straight line with a dip at the end. I liked it.

Faizullah is from the region, but also had a grant to do research on the effects of the rape by interviewing survivors. The book has this constant tension about what right does Faizullah have to these stories, and where does she, the interview, sit in the poetry collection.\n\nIt's a stunning book, and Faizullah doesn't shy away from the issues of how her research and her poetry sit in concert. I think there's a poem about her masturbating in her hotel room. She mentions the books she's reading. She also has poems that include snippets of the interviews she does with the survivors. It's a book a bit at odds with itself, but is honest about this.\n\nMost of the poems have medium length lines, and stanzas of just a couple lines (maybe 4-6? I don't really know, I got it from the library so I'm drawing from memory). But she uses indents widely, often in a repeated pattern. What did that structure do for the book, which is so much based in history, interview, the intertwining of voices? It had a consistency that the other books Jay recommended didn't have, and perhaps that was the point -- that sometimes a book should stick to the form it needs to inhabit.",

Anyway, the book.\n\nPhew, I liked it a lot. The poems were intense, tightly wound. There was an anti-elegy poem, about who are we to call up the dead and make them dance. A poem about how his mother used to recommend he go for a run when he was sick, and now he sometimes gives this advice to his students. I'm losing some of the other poems, about his sisters, about police violence, historical poems about a black cross-dresser, a poem after Frank O'Hara. There was one poem none of us were a fan of, a long poem that seemed like erasure but didn't seem to be an erasure of anything. But mostly it was a great collection, that I would like to return to because I feel I could learn a lot from it.",

Other times they got political. I liked a lot of them. I liked the project idea, and what he did with it. One starts moving into many different languages.

It's originally in Spanish, but the book is bilingual with the original Spanish on the left page and the translated English on the right.\n\nMauve orchids of the sea is how Proust (apparently) described jellyfish. The poetry is either a series of vignettes, or one or two long poems, where each page has maybe 14 lines (I forget exactly how many, but the same every time, and centered). The poetry is a bit all the over the place, kind of a lyrical musing on life (love?) that uses a biological or molecular or sea lens or diction. Now that I'm actually reading Proust, I see his influence, as the poems kind of sweep through thoughts without much grounding. But that creates for a very musical and lyrical poetry. I read it twice, and it's a lovely read, though you have to be okay with letting go of meaning and just relish in the beauty of the words and the moments of lucid thoughts. Ambitiously I hoped to one day try to read the Spanish, but as it were I occasionally dipped into it but mostly stuck to the English.",

It took me a while to get to it, but once I did I remember being astounded. So intensely sonic and stunning. Really no one contemporary I read is working with sound the way he is. His poems were more lyric, more fantasy based in the kernel of reality (I think he said this in an interview). It's a hard book about violence and pain and suffering. The epigraph is a Kafka quote, something like: The man drowning and the man in ecstasy, both through up their arms. And this so perfectly describes the book: pain and pleasure, violence and joy, pushed up with the heat of the sound of words carved out next to each other.",

So I read this one.\n\nIt's great, very him, the poems are looong and skinny, garden paths, so similar to Saeed Jones in theme but couldn't be more different in the way they get at this theme. Saeed is almost dreamlike, whereas Ross Gay is narrative, steeped in the reality of a fig tree or a chat with an old friend (named, I think). The sound is simpler, not so heavy. At the end we sense the urgency of the book, Gay starts to address the reader more directly, trying to say it more plainly, asking us to understand that his gratitude is unending but also seeped in a history of violence.",

It's still seeped in the natural world, it's still direct and visual and bright and multicultural. I got my copy from the Columbia Library. It's perhaps even more in the natural world than Oceanic. Lots of the poems are noted with where they take place: Alaminos, Philippines; Kerala, India; Wachula, Florida. There are a couple unusual poems (for her); long and skinny and repetitious, or most footnotes.

So later when it was picked for Book Culture's book club book I bought it, since I like the book club and it means the book was 20% off. But then quarantine happened so the book club was cancelled.\n\nAnyway, so I heard Danez Smith read some of the poems at the launch, all of which were amazing. their reading is so good it's hard to explain, it's not the rhythm of slam but it's the energy and engagement of it. One poem they read was called, I think, 'my president', which is basically a litany of all the people who are their president, a long list of ordinary and extraordinary people who make up america. Another was about getting beat up in school, and the kind of beauty in getting beaten up, and having your group of friends who would beat up someone for you.\n\nThe book is about friendship, but it also has an alternate title to 'homie' that I can't say, and so a lot of the book is about Blackness, so especially Black friendship, and in that way it's not exactly for me. So much of it I could never read out loud. It's a strong book that has the kind of rawness I've learned to love in Tommy Pico's work, a kind of intenseness that goes back at least to Audre Lorde (who I need to read more of).\n\n&nbsp;",

There were a few that maybe went over my head, or required more attention than I gave it. So it was nice to unpack those at the book club.\n\nThere was the story of the man with the moonshaped scar, who tells a story about a weak rebel (in Ireland?) who ends up betraying the cause and then you learn the narrator is the man who betrayed and told the story from the other perspective to make sure the listener didn't feel empathy for him. There's the man who was working on a play and then gets arrested as a Jew in pre-WWII Prague and sentenced to be shot and asks god for an extra year to work on the play and gets granted that extra year in the second before he's shot. There's the library of babel, in which every book every possible exists and people live in this strange geometric and infinite library looking for meaningful books. There's the story about the lottery of life (which I had read before). The story about a man who turns up to a temple and sleeps all day creating a world/new man in his head only to eventually wake and find he is a created man (because he can walk through fire without harm).\n\nBorges lived almost through the whole 1900s, from 1899 to 1986, which is crazy. This made him a contemporary of Italo Calvino, who lived from 1923 to 1986; Calvino seems to be very inspired by Borges (or perhaps the other way around).\n\nThis book has SO MANY new ideas about what fiction can do.

I remember buying it and reading it for the reading that Angel hosted a while ago, and feeling like it was good but I didn't quite get it. I also read/listened to a bunch of interviews with Jericho Brown. And Valentina wanted to do the radio show about Jericho. This time around I found it so much stronger and more enticing. I felt the Duplex form more than I did the first time; the first time I found it too repetitive and this time I found it more moving, more intricate, more bold. Learning more about his reasoning of the form helped, but also maybe I was just in a different place. Especially talking about it on the radio show the poems are so deep and interwoven. I love the poem 'Good White People' and its dive into our collective trauma, our lack of innocence.\n<p class=\"verse\">A single anthem of blood\u2014\nAll is stained. She was ugly.\nI\u2019m ugly. You\u2019re ugly too.\nNo such thing as good white people.</p>\nAnd then the poem about Black people gardening, the mothers pulling up the flowers from the earth even though they leave for work before the flowers open up to the sun. The poem about Ganymedes, the beautiful mortal abducted and raped by Zeus in exchange for some horses.\n\nA man trades his son for horses.\nThat's the version I prefer. I like\nThe safety of it, no one at fault,\nEveryone rewarded. God gets\nThe boy. The boy becomes\nImmortal.\n\nUgh, it's so good. His poetry is haunting, it strikes so deep, the speaker is so honest, it does this thing where poetry cuts through the crap. I understand why he won the Pulitzer. Also listening to him talk about how the book is so much about rape, how we're unable to say the word, to call it what it is, how we don't even really know what it is. In one of his Duplexes he writes\n\nThe opposite of rape is understanding\n\nAnd I just think about that all the time, the hard truth of it. Because rape is a fundamental lack of understanding, and also our inability to say or acknowledge or grapple with rape is a reflection of our understanding.\n\nAnyway, I love this book. I quickly looked back on my notes from the first reading -- I did find it striking and strong, but I knew I needed to return to it to really understand it.",

                    "notes": "This was a CS PhD book club book. It's also a classic, and written in 1984. I had a bit of trouble getting into it. It read like an action movie, with a loner main character in an underworld that felt very much like what people *think* an underworld of assassins and drug addicts is like, rather than maybe what it's actually like. (I don't know what it's actually like, but the depiction in this book felt stylized, like a caricature.) I also struggled to follow the plot, often not quite sure what was going on and reading the Wikipedia plot summary to make sure I properly understood (often I did not).\n\nWhen we talked about it we talked about the loner super-hacker as this classic image in cyberpunk, and we couldn't tell if Gibson invented this or was playing into this stereotype. It did seem to have this arc of learning to love yourself. The book wasn't totally soulless. But I struggle to like anyone in the book, even if I thought the plot was fun and the ideas about AI fun.\n\nI was also surprised that Neuromancer is the name of part of the AI (the other part is called Wintermute). For some reason I thought neuromancer was gonna be the word to describe the hacker, Case, as in some who can control or speak to the neurons.\n\nI also found the description of the matrix, or rather what hacking _was_, pretty confusing. What made Case this amazing hacker? It felt more like he was good at video games, or magic. The difference between scifi and fantasy is one I don't really understand. This was clearly scifi, but the matrix stuff was a bit elusive for me.\n\nThe focus on biological modifications as a central part of the futuristic world was interesting. Also hilarious reference to the \"micro softs\", little usb drive-style things inserted into the head to give you new abilities.",

                    "notes": "This was suggested by Brad as a book club book kind of right at the start of quarantine. He was obsessed with Lydia Davis, who had just done a new translation of Swann's Way, and I had never read Proust and it seemed like a good idea, for some reason, especially with quarantine. It took me a while to get it, but eventually it got in and I found it so boring and hard to follow, like I would reread whole pages feeling like I had lost the thread. But around 30 or 40 pages in I started to get into it, and understand the uniqueness of what Proust was doing in modeling the interiority of the narrator; at the beginning it's of the speaker as a child, wanting a kiss from his mother but being sent to bed before this because guests are there at dinner. And the intensity we got of this child's inner state, the incredible, un-toppable need of his for the kiss, what the kiss meant, the way he planned the whole evening around the kiss, and the distress of not getting it, was such an amazing view into the child's head. Yes, the long sentences, yes the incredible description, but ultimately I thought Proust excelled in this intense interiority, the feeling of being inside someone's head not exactly through what they're thinking but how they are feeling. It makes me think a bit of Unbearable Lightness of Being and the dictionary of misunderstood terms. Everyone has their unique wrap around language, to get into their feelings we must also know what everything _represents_ to them, what it _means_ to them in particular. And this is what Proust did.\n\nIt's a weird book, with the first section about Proust as a child in Combray, then a large middle section about Swann in love with Odette, which Proust (or the speaker, or the mix) only heard about as a child because the affair happened before he was born, and then a final shorter section of Proust as a slightly older child in love with (or just obsessed by?) a neighborhood girl, Swann's daughter. (It seems like even though Swann and Odette seem to fall apart at the end of the middle portion, they are married in the third.)\n\nThe middle section, Swann in Love, was also excellent, though there's a fair bit about French high society I don't think I quite got, and eventually I started to get bored with being in a particular state of mind with Swann that I found at the outset understandable but eventually obnoxious, like his jealousy. I didn't quite understand the power dynamic of the relationship, perhaps because I didn't quite understand the power dynamics of the society, but mostly I felt I understood infatuation, and the emblems we create of love and affection, and the conflicting nature of affection. Often Swann comments that he doesn't really like Odette, doesn't find her attractive physically or intellectually, and yet he is so in love. It's a weird dynamic. Probably not the one I more empathized with, though I think I do understand.",

                    "notes": "I'd been meaning to read this for so long, I bought it on a whim at the outset of quarantine along with Parable of the Sower, perhaps feeling I should be reading more Black writers, and in particular feeling I should have read some of the most famous. I was reading it when the George Floyd protests started, and suddenly it felt very apt, like I had started my homework a bit early.\n\nHer writing reminded me a bit of Ursula Le Guin's nonfiction, though they were contemporaries so who knows who influenced who. But it was so stark and honest, that was what I found similar, very clear in observations and thought. The first essay is about a trip to Russia, and her observations of communism and its successes and failures. The second essay is \"Poetry is not a Luxury\" in which she writes:\n\n\"I speak here of poetry as revelatory distillation of experience, not the sterile word play that, too often, the white fathers distorted the word poetry to mean -- in order to cover a desperate wish for imagination without insight.\"\n\nThere is an essay called Uses of the Erotic, which as a house as Brambleberry we listed to as a speech (a lot of the essays were originally speeches) because Rebeccah had recently listened to it and felt it really articulated a lot of her feelings. It's about the erotic as a source of power, in terms of joy and fullness, something to bring into our work, as opposed to the pornographic, which is the superficial, the surface-reading of joy. I felt I understood it much more as a speech, though perhaps it was just revisiting it, as much of the book could use. In this essay she writes:\n\n\"For once we begin to feel deeply all the aspects of our lives, we being to demand from ourselves and from our life-pursuits that they feel in accordance with that joy which we know ourselves to be capable of. Our erotic knowledge empowers us, becomes a lens through which we scrutinize all aspect of our existence, ...\"\n\nThere's an interview between her and Adrienne Rich which is super interesting, especially when they have this discussion about Adrienne pushing Audre Lorde to explain her feelings more fully, because Adrienne Rich knows she doesn't fully understand Audre Lorde's position as a Black woman and doesn't want to pretend she does. But she also doesn't want to slip into saying there's no way they can ever understand each other. There's this other part where Audre Lorde talks about learning how to write prose, and how poetry was her main was of expressing herself, a very honest way outside of the confines of grammar or ideas of prose, and then learning about grammar was empowering in its own way:\n\n\"I learned that grammar was not arbitrary, that it served a purpose, that it helped to form the ways we thought, how as children we learn this, and why. It's like driving a car: once we know it we can choose to discard it or use it, but you can't know if it has useful or destructive power until you have a handle on it.\"\n\nIt's a wide reaching book. She never capitalizes \"america\". She writes as a Black woman, as a lesbian, as a mother (there is an essay about her son), as someone in an interracial marriage. She also writes a lot about the fear of lesbianism in Black communities, especially Black activism.\n\nIn Age, Race, Class, and Sex she has this great line about poetry I really liked and felt:\n\n\"Of all the art forms, poetry is the most economical. It is the one which is the most secret, which requires the least physical labor, the least material, and the one which can be done between shifts, in the hospital pantry, on the subway, and on scraps of surplus paper. Over the last few years, writing a novel on tight finances, I came to appreciate the enormous differences in the materials demands between poetry and prose.\"\n\nThere's also this great line about her relationship with Frances that made me think hard about my relationship with Silas and if we are doing the same kind of hard work of being together:\n\n\"I am also speaking of a love shaped by our mutual commitment to hard work and confrontation over many years, each of us refusing to settle for what was easy, or simple, or acceptably convenient.\"\n\nI really enjoyed it, I want to return to it, I want to read more of her poetry.",

Set in 2024, in LA, with the USA basically a third world country, climate change run amok, a small community collapses and our narrator, Lauren, sets off on a journey north, simultaneously building a small community around herself and her idea of a religion-esque thing called Earthseed whose main premise is God as change.\n\nIt's a great book, the story and characters rich, the racial undercurrents strong, like the water of the world they live in, a really interested foreword by N. K. Jemisin, who found the narrator unbelievable when she was younger but came to like her more as she grew older (Jemisin, not the character). It had a good pace, it felt like it might really be like to live in a collapsed society, as opposed to Neuromancer which felt like the videogame version of lawlessness. This book felt real: the learning to fire guns, the decisions about risks and rewards, the mistrust of strangers and how you might build trust, the close calls, the unavoidable death, the luck. It felt grounded, and Lauren really is mapping out how to survive in this world, preparing for it, navigating it as best she can, which turns out to be very well.\n\nDefinitely want to read the sequel, Parable of the Talents.",

The TV show held so close to the book that now I have trouble distinguishing them. I flew through the book; it was fun, intense, more pointed than Conversations with Friends (2 main characters instead of 4). Oh, I remember now, I bought it used off of Alibris because I kept meaning to borrow it from Brad but he left it in his office.</p>\n\n<p>Had the feeling of desperately wanting the two characters, Marianne and ??, to get together, if only they could be honest with themselves and each other about their feelings. Felt like a continual misunderstanding between them, based on insecurities and lack of self-knowledge, and if they could just be free of that then they would be happy. In this way it was a book that had you rooting for them; they weren't bad people, just confused and orbiting each other.</p>\n\n<p>I had thought Normal People was Rooney's first book, but actually it's her second and I think it's sharper than Conversations with Friends, cleaner, going deeper into the characters because there are less relationships to navigate; just this one.</p>\n\n<p>When we watched the TV show it was incredibly fun and I described it as \"relationship bingo\", where I was always asking, \"Ok, so who has made that relationship mistake?\"</p>\n\n<p>I didn't exactly like the portrayal of the male character's writing career; the way it kind of falls into his lap. Perhaps I'm just jealous that has never happened to me; that in fact I try quite hard and it doesn't fall into my lap. I also find it strange when writers write characters into writers, if it's a kind of fantasy for them or if it's simply what they know.</p>\n\n<p>Curious what it would be like on a second read, if I would be so engaged and invested in the characters again or if it rings a little flatter if I'm outside the newness of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

I kind of wanted to review it, and maybe I still will, but again I don't feel exactly like the right person. (Though perhaps I am?)</p>\n\n<p>It's a skinny book, and some of the poems include the code or are more clearly code outputs than others. Some are from the Travesty Generator code, which if I recall is a markov chain-esque generator from a source text, and sometimes she had the generated poem for different bigram lengths. It is quite intense, the re-writings of some source text by the generator, getting at the gestalt and the it-ness of the poem but rearranging its elements.</p>\n\n<p>I think I preferred those kinds of poems to the ones that were closer to code output, like printing out permutations. I find that kind of poetry more visual anyway, always unsure if I should be reading the whole thing or just absorbing the look of it because it contains so much repetition or has so little syntax to string me along.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly I was worried about reading it, because I generally find computational poetry a bit hard to appreciate, it often being so conceptual, but actually it was a good read, challenging but lots of it actually steered close to more \"traditional\" contemporary poetry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

It's a series of essays, and the subtitle is 'resisting the attention economy' or something like that. Someone recently said on Twitter that it was marketed more as self-help than culture; that it's actually more like Trick Mirrors by Jia Tolentino and should have gotten a similar reception. In some ways I agree; like Trick Mirrors it claims to be about the internet but actually isn't that much about the internet. I think How to Do Nothing actually has more of a through-line than Trick Mirror, but is also much more calm in the writing style. I found Trick Mirrors overwhelming, and actually didn't finish it because the writing style wore me down.</p>\n\n<p>I had an almost opposite experience with How to Do Nothing, where it was actually quite boring a lot of the time, at least in first few essays, and I often found myself daydreaming and staring out from the porch instead of reading it, which in a way felt appropriate. The discussion of failed utopias and ancient Greek philosophers didn't really get me going; it was interesting but wore on a little too long for me.</p>\n\n<p>I think at heart the book was about how to respond to a problematic world. 'Doing nothing' isn't about leaving society (e.g. utopia experiments) but rather trying to observe the world from a third location -- not in it, not out of it, but on the edge, participating but cognizant of its problems. It was also about a return to place, physical place, and bioregionalism; really it was about paying attention, but that the attention needs to be slow, and contextual, and this is nearly impossible on the internet but in physical place we can attempt to achieve this contextualized, shared understanding. Place also puts us in conversation with the people around us; we are all thrust into the same place in a way we aren't really online.</p>\n\n<p>So overall I actually loved the book, even though it was slow, and it was kind of exactly what I needed. i haven't yet gotten a plant app, to help me learn the names of the plants, but it put me in that direction. I think there is a way in which I am very much <em>not</em> about this, because I think the book is asking for free time, for daydreaming, for caring in a slow way that isn't about reward. And I am very goal-driven. But it showed me the value of another way, and a way to get there, which just requires some time to pause and attend to the world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

The last section, a set of prose poems, it turns out (from reading the notes) that some of the poems were loose translations while others were responses to the original text. </p>\n\n<p>It was a strange book.

I couldn't figure out how to get a physical copy quickly, at least not a hardcover one, so I got it on the Kindle.

It's the kind of book you can inhale.</p>\n\n<p>The book follows a young Black woman as she enters a relationship with an older white guy who has permission from his wife to sleep with other women. Their relationship starts online, and then moves into the physical world, and the narrator (the young woman) is hyper aware of all the weird power dynamics in their relationship, as the older guy is well-to-do and lives in the suburbs whereas she is poor working an editing job which at some point she loses. The woman is hyper aware of everything: she's constantly commenting on how she's viewed, how she's viewing others. The book is action packed but also incredibly internal and psychological. Unlike something like a Sally Rooney book, where the internality of the characters reflects their total lack of understanding of themselves, this narrator is pretty on top of it, faltering at times but at least working hard to put it together.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually the woman ends up staying with the guy and his wife and their adopted Black daughter, that the woman tries to help with some Black culture stuff, like how to do her hair, since she's the only Black person in the whole neighborhood and is pretty friendless. Yet she's also in some ways happy, or at least content with her situation, having had bad foster homes in the past.</p>\n\n<p>The ending of the book packs a punch. A throughline of the book is the narrator's painting, which she loves, and at the end we get this musing on how painting is about leaving a mark, that she wants someone to know she was here, that someone like her was here. And that's what the book is about (or at least that's how I read it) that these stories exist, that the characters in them want to be seen, that life and art is about seeing and being seen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

But eventually I finished it, and actually we chose it for the next CS PhD book club book, even though I'd already read it.</p>\n\n<p>I liked it a lot. I'd call it a series of memoir-esque essays from Kimmerer who's a biologist as well as indigenous, and the way she sees those two in concert, and sometimes sees them at odds. The book is a lot about the long history of indigenous people being in good relation with the earth, biologists in their own way learning the songs or language of the plants instead of simply the names. Some of her research is about how indigenous groups are doing what I might call permaculture-- the way they harvest or use plants actually helps some plants grow, and so some plants are going extinct where there aren't indigenous groups to coexist. But the book also talks about her children, watching them go to college, camping with her parents, tapping maple trees for maple syrup, cleaning up the pond by her house so she can kayak and her kids can swim in it. She talks about what it means to be a good immigrant, the focus of gratitude in indigenous groups, the need to respect old knowledge as well as new.</p>\n\n<p>In the book club we discussed being city kids, and learning indigenous history through the book, and how to access nature when our work is bound up in computers. (Sorry, no answers, mostly questions.) Tim said he's thought about going to live more rural-ly; Kahlil and I said we didn't think we could do it. (Or maybe, just don't want to do it.)</p>\n\n<p>Still, we all were swept into her world, and considered reading her first book, which seems to be mostly about moss, to learn more from her.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

                    "notes": "<p>Wow, this was an amazing book. I knew a bit about Malcolm X -- radical left Black activist, started as anti-desegregation, part of Nation of Islam -- but really just some buzz words surrounding him. His life story was truly amazing, through his childhood in which his father is murdered and his mother taken into an asylum, to doing well in an all-white school, to leaving it all to live with a cousin in Boston, and then to his hustling in Boston and eventually NYC, the dancing, the gambling, the burglary, the drugs, eventually jail, which is when his brother introduces him to Nation of Islam (which I also didn't know much about), and then Malcolm's ascension to being Elijah Muhammad's right-hand man (Muhammad was the leader of Nation of Islam), and drastically increasing Nation of Islam's reach, and then learning of Muhammad's infidelity, then being outed by Nation of Islam, then going to various Middle Eastern countries, visiting Mecca, seeing the racially diverse orthodox Islam, coming back to the U.S. with a completely different approach, and shortly thereafter being murdered by a follower of Nation of Islam.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, this guy lived a LIFE. A hugely varied, hugely influential, hugely dramatic life. It also struck me how truly open he was to new ideas; it's no small feat to essentially partially lead a new religion and then, upon learning more, turn your back on some of its ideals in face of new information. The dedication to truth, or rather the openness to it, was astounding. </p>\n\n<p>I also thought his relation to other Black activist movements in the 50s and 60s, i.e. Dr. King's time, was super interesting. Having come from the ghetto, he was mistrustful of successful Black folk who seemed to want to assimilate; he thought that was blind to the evils of while folk, who would never allow true assimilation. His perspective changed somewhat after he had this life-altering experience of visiting Mecca, but I think people recognized some truth in his reading of the situation. And I see that even now in activist movements that say we must lift all people up, and those most at risk (right now we'd say something like disabled trans Black women) need to be brought up with the rest and if they aren't then the movement isn't working right. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, it was a truly amazing read, and now I feel like reading other biographies, like of Dr. King, might be a good way to learn more history.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

                    "notes": "<p>I picked this up at the Harvard Bookstore when I went with Rodrigo. Mostly we went to pick up the book of Ted Chiang short stories, but it was also the first time I'd actually been in a bookstore since the pandemic started. I was also looking for Emergent Strategy. But I also browsed! Which was very fun and I noticed this novel called Strangers in Budapest and I wanted to get it, because it was set in/about Budapest and I like reading books set in/about Budapest.</p>\n\n<p>The story follows a couple from Massachusetts who have just adopted an infant child who go to Budapest for a year while the husband tries to start a business around cell phones and cell towers. It's set in the 90s, and in Budapest few people have cell phones. The wife leaves her job which has something to do with helping the homeless, and we mostly follow her perspective. In Massachusetts their neighbors were actually from Budapest, so they do have a small connection to place, but mostly they go because it seems like doing business in Eastern Europe is hot. Also there's a sense of wanting to do something wild, and also for the wife to maybe get away from her family, which has this tragic past where her sister suffered some kind of traumatic brain injury (which retarded her for life) at the accidental hand of her brother. The brother ends up killing himself.</p>\n\n<p>In Budapest their Massachusetts-neighbors ask them to check in on another American friend of theirs staying in Budapest, who turns out to be this old guy convinced his daughter's husband killed her with painkillers. The daughter had a disease... cerebral palsy? Something that was slowly atrophying her muscles. So the wife gets wrapped up a bit in this guy's search for the husband, who we eventually learn is also the translator for some of the husband's business partners.</p>\n\n<p>There's a big showdown at the end where the wife gives the old guy the address of the translator/murderer, because she's going there for a work dinner party, and the old guy turns up while the dinner party is still going on and accuses him of the murder which he kind of admits to and then they shoot each other and both die.</p>\n\n<p>So it's a suspenseful book. It was a fine book, like a bit mediocre but easy to read. The writing wasn't great; it's interesting how even small things can pull me out of the narrative. I thought the wife's backstory was interesting but kind of tailed out like this big mystery that it wasn't really. And the old guy/son-in-law story line felt a little weak, perhaps because it seemed to pain the old guy as a bit crazy but it turned out he was right, or maybe because the old guy's reactions were a bit crazy. Perhaps they were real, I'm not really sure what happens in that kind of situation, but it felt unreal.</p>\n\n<p>I also felt like the wife's do-good-er-ness was... over played? The narrator wasn't painting her as a saint, but I did feel like her desire to help people for whom she had no particular relation was... a bit empty? A bit unclear? Again, I don't know what that's like, but it felt a little ungrounded. </p>\n\n<p>But what I liked was the descriptions of Budapest, and I think it painted an interesting portrait from the perspective of Americans. It talked a lot about the personality of Budapest-- the city but also the people, as being reserved and kind of serious. Also of having this heavy, war-filled past. But it was still clearly a perspective. Perhaps what I need next is a book set in Budapest by a Hungarian. As Marwa Helal wrote in her poetry book, and I think she was quoting someone else (I want to say Camus but that doesn't make any sense) if you're from Egypt writing about Egypt you never talk about camels-- because they're everywhere and kind of unremarkable. Only a foreigner writes a story about Egypt and keeps mentioning camels.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->",

I thought I'd be really into Pleasure Activism, but Angbeen said she preferred Emergent Strategy and when I went to the Harvard Bookstore (first time I'd been inside a bookstore since the pandemic began!) and had a look at Pleasure Activism I realized it was a bit more literally about pleasure, maybe akin or in response to or with Audre Lorde's esssay on the power of the erotic, as opposed to essays about how to find joy and pleasure in activism. Anyway, so that cemeneted my desire to read Emergent Strategy instead.\n\nIt's an interesting a book-- it outlines some of brown's ideas about how to do activism, which is inspired by some features in nature. It's a bit casual-- almost too casual for me at times, with recorded conversations and notes from others. I get the idea of decentering herself (a lot of the idea is that no one person can be the touchstone of a successful movement because that's not very resilient) but I do often want the guiding hand of an author and I felt sometimes she gave that up.\n\nStill, I liked a lot of the ideas and towards the end it felt a bit more like general life advice than specific to organizing work, though perhaps that makes sense. She's a facilitator, and I was never exactly sure what she was talking about or exactly what kind of work she does. I think I kind of generally got the idea -- helping organizations figure out their shit -- but I could have used some really concrete examples to ground myself in her work.\n\nI lent it to Rebeccah so that we could talk about it. I do think it's a book worth returning to or flipping through for ideas."

Anyway, I'd been wanting to read some Ted Chiang, he just seemed to be popping up everywhere, and I totally loved all of these stories.\n\nThese are really idea-based stories, kind of like hard sci-fi where there's a conceit of how the world is different (like gravity is different or something) and then the story plays out the consequences of that difference. Except Chiang's differences were super interesting-- like what if we could really built a tower to the vaults of heaven, or what if there was an experimental drug that made a person increasingly intelligent, or what if AI really did surpass human scientific endeavors. I was enthralled by all his ideas, and the story telling he weaved into these truly interesting ideas.\n\nSara was complaining that short story collections are difficult because you have to enter a new world every time you sit down, but I think in the case of good stories you get to enjoy that again and again, knowing the author will have another good world and will guide you into it with a steady hand.\n\nI should definitely read his earlier collection, Exhalations, which also got a lot of good press."

Anyway, I loved this collection; Jemisin is a master of worlds with interesting conceits and drawing you in quickly. The introduction was also interesting, describing her growth as a writer and the encouragement she was given to write short stories as a kind of exercise that she at first resisted.\n\nThe first story about a city being born is clearly the basis for her new novel, and there was a story that was clearly the initial ideas of the Broken Earth trilogy. But the rest was new to me (and even those it was interesting to see the ideas in the short story, which are so much slimmer and tightly wound than in a novel). There was a great kind of lesbian historical cyberpunk story about a spy from the Haiti in America looking for an engineer to solve some specific problem they were having, and a story about the people left behind on earth after most people leave to live in a space ring.\n\nThinking now about Ted Chiang, I think Jemisin's story are less 'hard' than his, or maybe more fantasy and less math-y; Chiang had a penchant for technical details and logicking things out, whereas Jemisim felt more centered on characters and ambiance. But they are both excellent; perhaps Jemisin was a tad more multicultural than Chiang though both drew upon a range of cultures or human experiences."

I think the last time I read it was when we had the book club at Rest Devices. Reading it again, the kind of teenage-ness of it struck me. In that, the narrator's philosophizing and focus on what the meaning of all actions are, reminded me of being a teenage and being so focused and obsesssed with meaning and understanding. I can see how that flavor of the novel could be annoying. There was someone new in the book club, a new student called Mia, who -- in response to my describing this -- said something like, 'But doesn't it bother you that adults don't worry about this anymore?' and honestly I felt like she was still in that teenage state.\n\nWhich is not to say I don't sincerely understand the feeling and get into bouts of worrying about the meaning of life, but I do it far less than as a teenager, and with a different attitude. More of a, I'm not sure there's any reality I'm missing, attitude, and instead focusing on my options and what will provide meaning to me. Maybe I have just let go of that incessant desire to make sense of the world, and just admit that there is not always something logical to uncover.\n\nBut I still enjoyed it, and I enjoyed revisiting the characters, and seeing their contrast. In particular I think the contrast between Tereza (commited to one thing) and Sabina (commited to nothing) struck me as a more binary. I also noticed that there's so much sex-- I learned this time that there is a movie based on the book, but I feel it would highlight how strangely raunchy the whole thing in. (Chad brought this up in the book club-- is Kundera always this obsessed with sex?)\n\nThe other thing that really struck me this time was the ambivalence of Tereza and Tomáš's commitment: despite decades of commitment, they each have regular or repeated moments of doubt. This struck me as a powerful portrait of a relationship that is truly commited, but that commitment doesn't mean absolute and never-failing belief; instead it can be a continual return to something. And I think that is more true in my life. I never feel completely and always commited to something or someone, but there are things and people I continually return to. And perhaps that is what commitment means to me."

I loved the idea of it: viewing narrative structures using structures from nature, and showing their variety. Of course we have the wave-- the 'traditional' narrative arc from Aristotle'-- but we also have the spiral, the radial/exposion, the cellular, the fractal. She then goes on to discuss examples of each.\n\nI feel I've read a couple books like this-- perhaps James Wood's How Fiction Works comes to mind-- where it's a real reader's book, mentioning and analyzing a bunch of famous books. That part was honestly the least interesting. I mean, yes, sure, okay, it's nice to see her show how a certain book can be viewed best as a cellular pattern, and I was excited to read about Eucalyptus, which is a book I vaguely remember reading as a kid in Australia, but generally if I hadn't read the book she was discussing it was a bit boring and kind of similar if I had. I mean, I liked it. But I don't really want to read a ton of books like this. They feel a bit too turned inward for me.\n\nBut I loved the idea of these different structures, and think it's a really cool way to do different computational stuff, which I often feel is stuck on the most boring ideas of art (at least the stuff coming out of computer science academia). I think they could also make really cool writing prompts, or even just metaphors to use to describe how different poems are working.\n\nIn fact, maybe I should use it to think about this writing I'm doing for CultureHub. It might help me structure or elucidate what I'm trying to do."

The subtitle is something like 'Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath', so I guess I knew it would vaguely be about them.\n\nTurns out it's a totally fascinating book, and kind of biography of the biographies of Sylvia Plath. There's plenty of literary drama: about the biographers who do and don't get permission from Plath's estate (run by Ted Hughes sister) and the backlash from both Ted Hughes and the eager public on the various biographies and memoirs written about or around Plath. It feels a bit like a big fight between presenting Plath as the hero and Hughes as the bad guy, and the opposite. (Plath and Hughes split up shortly before she killed herself.)\n\nWhile the literary drama is fun, the book is truly interesting because of the writing, and Malcolm's self reflection on the act of biography, which she portrays as a ... kind of act against the dead and their surrounding living. Biographers are out to get information about a real person, even if that information does not necessarily want to get out. And that's a big part of the intrigue around Plath, because it's a very curious situation but the living around her don't necessarily feel that it belongs to the public, especially while Hughes and her children are still alive.\n\nAnyway, it was a very intriguing and captivating book, with excellent writing, though the ending didn't really hold up for me. Then again, it's amazing the book had any kind of useful narrative structure at all, given it's hyper self-reflection and kind of amorphous subject. (If I were to give it a structure from Meander, Spiral, Explode, I'd probably go with... spiral, where it spirals around Plath's life, or maybe cellular, where it takes all these people who intersected with Plath and talks with each of them in a similar way.)"

I wanted to read more of Lorde's poetry, after reading Sister Outsider. Shira Erlichman is really into Audre Lorde, plus she's super famous, etc.\n\nI really loved them. It's tempting to call them simple, because they don't adhere to a formal rhyming or metrical scheme, and they tend toward straightforward sentences without lofty metaphors or big associative jumps. But really I think the word is 'cutting' or 'unhibited' or 'passionate' or 'true'. There's something about her language that has a strength that perhaps more 'complicated' poems lack. And of course they do deal in metaphor and associative jumps, they just perhaps come across so naturally, so truthfully, they don't necessarily feel like poetic techniques.\n\nIt's truly unlike anything I've ever read; the hard straightforwardness that is both situated in Lorde's experience as a Black lesbian mother feminist, but also extends beyond herself into the Amazon (which honestly I did not always catch the reference) and into that sublime human experience poetry attempts to touch.\n\nThis book is definitely deserving of another read."

I kind of recognized the cover, but didn't know what it was about or the author, just had a sense it was a popular book and maybe I should read it. I wanted to get through my existing unread books rather than buy new ones, so I finally started this. And I loved it! It's a kind of twirling book, with a large-ish cast of characters that we get to peak into their lives. It starts with two boys in Ireland, and their mother dying, and one brother describing the kind of unreasonable charity of the other, who becomes a priest and is shipped off to NYC. Then we stay mostly in NYC, meeting the sex workers he befriends and takes care of, and then a judge, and wait actually we started with Philippe Petit's wire walk between the World Trade Center buildings in NYC in 1974. Actually the whole book kind of revolves around that moment, and where people were, and the judge that gives the wire-walker his punishment, and his wife, and how she befriends a Black woman who ends up taking care of the children of a sex worker that the brother-priest had befriended, etc. etc. everyone's lives wrapped up together in a sprawling mess.\n\nThe prose is intoxicating, the stories spun out and intersecting and each character getting their due, and the New York of the 70s spinning, rich and well-researched. It was a great book."

So I guess... after I moved in with Tim, which was my third year, which must have been... 2019. Anyway, I wasn't super thrilled when I got it; I read some criticism of it somewhere, or heard the criticism second hand, and just never felt compelled to get to it. But I eventually read it, maybe because I'd chatted with Sam a couple times about Jonathon Safran Froer. Or maybe because I was just trying to get through my pile of books to read.\n\nAnyway, I read it, and I actually enjoyed the first and last sections, which tied this personal musings on how to deal with climate change on an individual level with both personal and general history about times when collective action has been taken: the U.S. in WWII, and his grandparents running from Nazi occupation. I felt this contextualizing of how much can one person do, how much is enough, resonated with me. But the middle sections -- a list of facts about climate change and animal agriculture, and then a dialogue with himself about feeling really guilty -- just didn't do anything for me. I don't want to read more facts, these dry numbers that I feel I already know, or at least know the gist of, and the dialogue with himself was so neurotic and guilt-ridden that I found it obnoxious.\n\nIn the last section he gets back to this more personal musing of how to feel in the face of climate change. So overall I'm glad I read it, but I found the middle a bit obnoxious and not sure I'd recommend it to anyone who wasn't already pretty pro- veganism.\n\nI discussed it with Brad when we went to the park with Elliot and Nathaniel. I forget the name of the park but it had been snowing and there was a frozen lake that people were ice skating on and one guy ice fishing. And then we watched the boys sled down a hill. Silas was there too. Brad mentioned he had read it and thought it was fine, but also that he feels there's nothing really he can do about climate change. I thought that was interesting -- I kind of disagree, but tend not to want to argue with people about it. I find people tend to need to come to it on their own. But I was surprised he read the book and felt that way, since I felt a big part of the book was acknowledging what one can and can't do, which I guess to me means noting what we can do. But maybe Brad just saw what he can't."

I also found Pachinko, and the short stories by Alison Munroe. So it was a good find! I'd been meaning to read this for a while, but it never seemed quite worth it, especially after Juhee said that it was fine but not amazing.\n\nAnyway so I picked up the free copy and read it, and really enjoyed it! I agree that it's not amazing, but I enjoyed her explanations of different internet linguistic phenomena, like how we use punctuation in texting to make the writing seem more like speaking (and we use it in similar ways people do with postcards) or how emojis are like gestures, or how when you got on the internet impacts if you think it's for meeting new people or just a new way of talking to people you already know. I also liked the bits on how people spoke in the early internet days, and how it has shifted, and how saying acronyms outloud is not a new phenomena. (I'm forgetting her example of when it happened pre-internet.)\n\nOverall I felt a bit thesis sof the book was that nothing is happening on the internet linguistically that is totally unprecedented. Language changes all the time, and of course we're going to see it change with the internet, but the way that it's changing isn't fundamentally different. I think she also drove home this point that the new ways of talking are not wrong, just new, and it reminded me of being told (or rather thinking) that using 'like' in weird ways, as in saying 'and then she was like, what do you mean?', isn't wrong or bad. It's just new, and older people might be upset about these new ways but I shouldn't feel bad for adopting them. Another cool study she talked about was that people who use a lot of internet slang are totally able to write in a formal way in other contexts. We are very good at code switching and understanding that different kinds of talking are appropriate in different venues.\n\nA last interesting thing I remember, and this is how she starts I think, is that the internet has allowed us to collect huge amounts of informal writing, which was never really possible before. First people there just wasn't a lot of informal writing, because writing was kind of intensive (like writing a letter) to be done informally, but also because most of the informal writing was very private. But now we have huge amounts of public informal writing, and that has allowed us to study informal language in a way that has never been done before. Cool!"

I really liked Stories of Your Life and Others, and hadn't realized that Exhalations was his newer collection (I was convinced it was his older one). I bought a copy at Harvard Bookstore and devored it pretty quickly after I started it. They were just as good as the previous book: great ideas that play out in fascinating ways. When we discussed it at the book club people complained a bit about the lack of character building or development, and that they didn't really care for the characters that much. I guess this is true, and a fair criticism. I did feel occasionally in this book that some of the stories felt a bit more like exploratory essays than short stories.\n\nExhalation was one of my favorites, about the robot that discovers he runs on air pressure, and thus eventually their civilization will slow to a stop when the air pressure is eventually completely released/equalized. And everyone loved the AI pet stories, in which a company designs these AI pets that a select number of users are very committed to (even after the company goes under) and continue to educate and raise them. The story about parrot intelligence didn't do too much to me. I loved the story about the memory cams, which is a journalist testing out this new essentially external videeo memory interweaved with a story about a tribal man in Africa learning to read and how becoming literate completely changes his view on life. I loved the descriptions of what it meant to learn to read and write, and how it shifted the way the man thought about language but also the world. Which other stories did I like? The artificial nanny story was cute but didn't do too much for me. Anyway, it was really good, and I hope he writes more! Though I think we all agreed that N. K. Jemisin's stories tended to be stronger -- more character and plot, while also having good ideas. Ah well."

Anyway, I'd been eyeing 'The Crying Book' for a while now; it popped up all over the place, even before I got depressed, but finally I got it. It's a bit like prose poetry, or maybe a lyric essay; a series of fragments about crying and her experiences and what it means to be depressed. A mix of science-y things, folklore, traditions, etc. around crying with her personal experience, her particular cries, how her husband deals with her crying, that kind of stuff. I really liked it. It didn't make me sad per se, which I guess I was worried about. It's not exactly a sad book, but it is about sadness."

It followed a multigenerational Korean family that spends several generations in Japan during Japanese occupation of Korea and then through WWII. I knew Japan occuped Korea, but I didn't appreciate that even Koreans who had lived in Japan for multiple generations were not granted full rights and were treated so poorly. I guess it's not too surprising -- very similar in the US -- but I just didn't know all that history.\n\nThe characters were really interesting, and it was especially amazing to see the grandmother character -- who is a child at the beginning -- live through so many different kinds of lives. Running a small seaside inn for sailors, living a normal-ish life in Japan, selling kimchi during the war, her children becoming somewhat wealthy, watching her grandchildren deal with racism in high school... that woman saw so much, lived so many different kinds of lives."

She hates the idea, and ends up meeting this kind of vagabond in the bush who tells stories about each of the trees. He's slowly identifying them, in his own way, but not really to win her, just because he knows it and wants to tell her stories. His competition is man from Adelaide who knows a lot about eucalyptus -- he's walking around with the father, slowly identifiying them all. Funnily enough I forget how it ends -- I think she ends up with the vagabond, and there's some reason he's there, he's been hired to plant the trees or maintain the fences or something, or maybe he makes the nameplates for the trees? Anyway, obviously I should read it again!

So it's about a future where most people now live in small, rural communities. No electricity, etc. Very interesting in terms of imagining what the world looks like when most people die. Also had the backstory of characters, and had nice tie-ins with different characters having connections from 'before'. I thought the ending was just the right amount of perfect fit. Not so perfect it feels cheesy, but perfect enough to make the book fun. I could go on about other details -- it mostly follows a traveling theatre, and the book starts with a famous actor having a heart attack on stage right before the pandemic hits. There's a comic book, created by the famous actor's ex-wife, and it gets into the hands of some of the main characters in the after times (there was just a tiny number made, she wasn't really interested in getting it published) but they have no idea where it's from or who the author is. There's an airport where there's a small community of people who got grounded there during the pandemic and never left. One guy starts a museum, and interviews people who comes by. The main 'bad guy' is a cult-like leader that leads a vicious gang. It was good."

It was a great, interesting book, that imagined Latasha Harlin's family's life after her murder, as well as the life of Soon Ja Du's children. (Though Cha fictionalizes these characters, she discusses all the research she did into the real murder, as well as the riots and the changing demographics of LA over the subsequent 30 years.) Soon Ja Du's younger daughter, born after the murder, doesn't know about her mother's history, who changed her name and starts a new life elsewhere in LA. The spark for the novel is someone shoots her mother in revenge, and the daughter learns about the history (her older sister knows, and that explains the tension in the family) and deals with her mother being close to death as well as the knowledge of her path. The crime fiction aspect is who attempted the murder of the Soon Ja Du character, but the playing out of her backstory, and the Latasha Harlins' brothers life, is what really makes the book interesting."

Paper, for instance, has edges and thus also has centrality. Across cultures, things that are centered are more important. It felt a bit like 'Metaphors We Live By' in that way -- trying to get at the embodied reasoning behind human behavior.

While Fishwork was about fish research (kind of -- I mean all poetry isn't really about anything) this was more of an identity book. The poet is lesbian and aboriginal, so it was a lot of that and I seem to recall some more erotic stuff. It was a bit... hm, more cutting than Fishwork? Just different. The vibe, that I'm recalling many months later (vibe is a word I've been using a lot these days), was more active... hm. What do I mean. Whereas Fishwork felt a bit like describing, Lemons in the Chicken Wire felt a bit more like experiencing. Maybe."

It's about their decision to transition to male, and the fraughtness of it, and their relationships as they go through this, and I remember this particular theme of not wanting to give up womanhood as an oppressive identity -- or rather maybe not wanting to take on the male identity which is tied into being the oppressor. Because he was in so many queer/lesbian spaces. Also I think he highlighted a lot of the uncertainty that can be part of transitioning -- there's a foreword that addresses this, and how he wanted or rather thinks it's fine/important to portray transitioning as messy, even if it's not politically more effective."

I'd seen it around but didn't realize it had won some big award. It was very good, very interesting, each chapter looking at some other aspect of extinction, framed through a single animal gone extinct. She started with the invention/discovery of the very idea of extinction. It's not obvious that there might have been animals on earth that are no longer here. But as we found more bones, we realized some of them must belong to animals we've never seen before. Other chapters talked about fossil records as ways of dating the history of the planet. And others talked about modern extinction, a result of global travel that introduces animals and fungi and bacteria into ecosystems that never had to deal with that before.\n\nA big theme I remember is that there have been many large extinctions in the past, and the study of those basically says that what made a species successful in the past doesn't really predict its success during an extinction event, because the climate radically changes. And I wanted to hear the author's opinion our current mass extinction, and if it should be viewed differently the past ones. But she never really weighs in on that, and so I felt the ending a bit lackluster, like she didn't take a side or present an opinion or argument. But she has written another book, so perhaps it's in there. Or maybe she doesn't want to take a perspective, and wants to leave it to the reader. But I wanted her to tell me what she thought."

                    "notes": "I really liked the beginning of the book. It was recommended to me by Madison Le at Google, and it's a Harvard Business School professor basically summarizing his business research and applying it to your life choices. The first chapter is about 'hygiene' versus 'motivation' in jobs -- being paid enough is hygiene, but after a certain amount it's not actually a motivator. But the rest was more analogical, and trying to apply business research to raising kids and such. That's fine, I didn't think it was wrong per se, I just got bored and didn't really want to take life advice from an HBS prof trying to pass off his life wisdom.\n\nHe has a bit about taking 'emergent' opportunities versus planning your career. Okay, sure. There was an interesting thing about what 'job' something does. He talks about research on how a store improves their milkshake. So instead of asking customers what they life in a milkshake, they ask what purpose does the milkshake serve. So if one person comes in and is getting a milkshake to drink during their morning commute, that's different than a parent getting their kid a milkshake as a treat. It's less about demographics and preferences than what role it's filling. Then he tries to make this relationship advice, like what role or 'job' are you doing for your partner. Kind of interesting.\n\nBut that's about when I got bored and starting skimming. He has a thing about not 'outsourcing' raising your kids, and that early experiences are really important and later ones mostly just follow from the early ones. Again, sure, but this guy doesn't study children he studies businesses. He has a thing about how your family needs to create a culture -- again, business culture being his actual research. I just felt like he started overstretching his field of expertise. Also, there's all this research on habits and nudging that is actually about this stuff that I've read.\n\nThe epilogue seemed super religious, so I skipped it. At that point I was hardly reading anyway. Still, I got something out of it."

I think this was one of the books I took to Sydney for quarantine but didn't end up reading, and I lugged it back to the U.S. and drove it halfway across the country because I'm that committed to always having options.\n\nI finally actually read it in NY, mostly on the subway to and from Columbia from my new apartment in Brooklyn. I loved it. Wow. This is the first stuff I've really read by Tracy K. Smith, maybe I read one of her poems in Rosebud's class but this is the first book, after having seen her books everywhere and the whole poet laurate of the us, and even hearing her on the New Yorker's poetry podcast.\n\nAt this point the details of the book are fading slightly. Her father is a scientist (maybe her mother too?). (I'd flip through the book but I'm in Cambridge and I'm pretty sure it's in NY.) The book is definitely about science, or science and astronomy is a theme, but I just remember almost every poem being so biting, so perfect. I don't remember it being formally very playful or anything, but that makes it even better -- that she was able to do so much with just the standard idea of a contemporary poem. Maybe I'm forgetting some unique details, but generally I just recall being stunned by it. I recently read another of her books -- Wade in the Water -- which hopefully I'll document before I forget it all..."

I read it all the way through, skipping I think just some more memoir-esque sections at the end. The book starts with following a pregnant dog through giving birth, and then follows the puppies into adulthood. It's a mix of information about dogs and advice on how to train them. I liked it, I felt it gave me a lot of context.\n\nI was also watching a ton of youtube videos, and eventually the information started to feel a bit repetitive or slow, and there were a few parts that felt... not out dated but kind of irrelevant, like this section on electric collars which I guess were gaining in popularity at the time."

Also apparently it's published sometimes as part of a longer book that includes the first three books in this series. Then it's called 'Lilith's Brood'. Anyway. I got it from the Carroll Gardens Brooklyn Library.\n\nI really liked it. Very interesting ideas. You follow Lilith, who's been held in some kind of alien cell since Earth had fallen apart. I'm forgetting exactly why Earth is fucked, but most humans die (war?) and the aliens come and rescue the remaining ones. The aliens have this thing where they genetically combine with other species they rescue, sharing abilities, and this freaks out Lilith who doesn't want to be bred. But Lilith is being prepared to take a group of humans back to earth to repopulate it. She gets embedded in an alien family, and they even give her some of their genetic powers. Then she 'wakes up' a group of humans and tries to convince and prepare them to go back to earth. This is where it felt a bit like Parable of the Sower, lots of humans trying to figure out how to cooperate outside of any safety and security. Eventually they get to go back to earth (so say the aliens) but I think at the end Lilith doesn't get to go. But the cliffhanger is that's she's pregnant with a guy from the group (who ended up getting murdered by someone else in the group) but the baby with be a new alien-modified baby."

Girmay has a series of poems called 'to the sea', which made me think of my own series 'dear ocean', and the similarities and differences between these titles.

Girmay is pretty historical in this book, in fact it reminded me a bit of The Deaf Republic in having characters and definitions and this kind of external structure to the poems.\n\nI lent the book to Kathy, but I think I need to read it again.

                    "notes": "Why did I get this? Was it  at the Harvard Bookstore Warehouse Sale? Maybe. I know I've been meaning to read something by Rebecca Solnit.\n\nI really liked this book. She wrote it shortly after Bush won a second term (I think) but she rereleased in 2016. The basic tenet of the book is that liberals have reason to hope, and in fact despair is a way of giving up, because hope necessitates/motivates action. But she goes into a lot of detail about various political situations which I didn't have enough context for to know if they were reasonale. Like she'd say this bad thing happened in the US (some law getting repealed or struct down by the supreme court or a war or something) but there was also a big gain in a Latin American country. So I wasn't sure I really believed/followed all of that.\n\nBut her articulation of how despair is a form of giving up really stuck with me. The title is from a Virginia Woolf quote about how the future is dark-- but by 'dark' she means 'obscured' or 'uncertain', not bad, and that dark is the best we can hope for for the future: to not be known or set in stone, but for there to be a chance for change. So the title is about being hopefully in the uncertainty of the future. Which I think to Solnit really means to act in the fact of an uncerain future. 'Hope is not a lottery ticket you can sit on the sofa and clutch, feeling lucky. It is an axe you break down doors with in an emergency.'\n\n'Hope locates itself in the premises that we don’t know what will happen and that in the spaciousness of uncertainty is room to act. When you recognize uncertainty, you recognize that you may be able to influence the outcomes–you alone or you in concert with a few dozen or several million others. Hope is an embrace of the unknown and knowable, a alternative to the certainty of both optimists and pessimists. Optimists think it will all be fine without our involvement; pessimists take the opposite position; both excuse themselves from acting. It’s the belief that what we do matters even though how and when it may matter, who and what is may impact, are not things we can know beforehand. We may not, in fact, know them afterward either, but they matter all the same, and history is full of people whose influence was most powerful after they were gone.'\n\n'Your opponents would love you to believe that it's hopeless, that you have no power, that there's no reason to act, that you can't win. Hope is a gift you don't have to surrender, a power you don't have to throw away.'\n\nSo she views hope as a kind of power that mustn't be given over to despair. Despire, to Solnit, is the worst. She talks about people despairing over a piece of climate legislation that passed-- that it's not enough, that it won't help. She says the people who worked on the legislation know it is not enough but are hopeful for more; uninvolved people tend to be the ones that criticize, and they are coming from a place of despair, that nothing will ever be enough.\n\nShe also has this idea that even in a loss, like an act that does not seem to cause the change we hope, there is sometimes a seed planted that grows something greater. So even if you lose a legislative battle, you may have started to shift people's attitudes that will allow you to win a bigger battle later. 'Cause-and-effect assumes history marches forward, but history is not an army. It is a crab scuttling sideways, a drip of soft water wearing away stone, an earthquake breaking centuries of tension. Sometimes one person inspires a movement, or her words do decades later, sometimes a few passionate people change the world; sometimes they start a mass movement and millions do; sometimes those millions are stirred by the same outrage or the same ideal, and change comes upon us like a change of weather.'\n\nShe also talks a lot about joy, and the importance of joy in activism. 'Joy doesn’t betray but sustains activism. And when you face a politics that aspires to make you fearful, alienated, and isolated, joy is a fine initial act of insurrection.' \n\n'Despair demands less of us, it’s more predictable, and in a sad way safer. Authentic hope requires clarity—seeing the troubles in this world—and imagination, seeing what might lie beyond these situations that are perhaps not inevitable and immutable'"

I just liked the look of the cover, and I guess the description. I read it mostly in Boston over the holidays. It's got themes of Asian American exclusion/exoticization as well as technology, similar to some of Franny Choi's stuff about the techno-eroticism of asian-looking people. But it was also very historical, and centered in NYC.\n\nThere are a series of poems about Anna May Wong, an early Chinese actress and the roles she was given and the yellow-face white actors took part in. There are lots of poems that respond to Asian Americans from the past. The last poem is about seeing Anna May Wong's face all over ads in NYC (the ad is for an exhibition about Asian exclusion/inclusion) and how the speaker recognizing Wong's face makes her feel at home, no longer a stranger.\n\nI think I liked this book because it had strong themes. It was a book where the notes and context are really helpful, and sometimes that bothers me, but I liked that she kept coming back to similar ideas (but with different characters?) over and over again."

                    "notes": "Brad got this for me for christmas. I didn't even know Alison Bechdel had a new book. I've actually never read her other ones, though I did see the musical adaptation of Fun Home with Ann and Dad (and someone else?) in Sydney and loved it. The book is kind of a memoir about her life through the lens of different fitness crazes she's been through, but it's also about her anxiety and drinking and relationships and attempt to find inner peace. It's woven in with history about the transcendentalists, Coleridge and Wordsworth and Margaret Fuller, as well as Jack Kerouac and another woman, and Adrienne Rich. You get to experience her success with Fun Home, her mother's death, and it takes us all the way through the pandemic.\n\nIt's interesting. Brad said she's a good person to spend time with, and the book feels essentially like that -- spending some time in Bechdel's mind, as she tries to tie some threads together about her life, or rather follow some threads through her life. Again, fitness is the central theme, but so is trying to find peace. She's a neurotic work-aholic, and fitness seems to fit into this. But fitness is also true and good, and I think that's an interesting struggle, and she ties it into her experiences of bliss, which tend to come from fitness (though have also come from mushrooms). These moments of bliss are like touchstones of the book, and she's always tryign to get them back and understand where they came from.\n\nWhat did I get out this book? There's something peaceful and nice about following someone through their maybe-too-self-aware journey of trying to find meaning and peace in their life, and having a good gut feeling that they'll get there (which she does). It's almost like better than self-help, to spend time with someone you feel some kind of connection to, similarity to, and getting to see how they did it. Because then maybe I can do it too."

I picked it up ages at my parents house, ironically, and then threw it in my bag because it was a short, fiction book on my too-read pile. Then my flight kept getting delayed and delayed, and I finished it shortly after we took off.\n\nI was interested in this book because I feel I had heard of it before, I think it's kind of a classic, and I think it's mentioned in Meander, Spiral, Explode, the nonfiction book I read about different narrative structures.\n\nIt's a book of fragments, or short vignettes, told from the perspective of Esmeralda, a young kid in America (some unstated town) from Mexico. The theme is her wanting a nicer house, but the one they have is on Mango Street. It chronicles her friends, and the neighbors that come in and out of her life. I'd guess she's around eight years old at the beginning, maybe a young teenager at the end. It does that nice thing where the narrator doesn't understand everything, or understands it in their own special childhood way. At one point she gets her fortune told, asking about what house she'll live in and is told 'a home in the heart' which upsets her. She has an older friend who gets married young (before the 8th grade) and goes off to live with her husband because she wants to get out, but the husband is another kind of cage. She experiences sexual assault, in a way she doesn't (can't won't) describe. One day the kids make fun of a nice old lady who is bedridden and blind and that day the lady dies. A neighborhood kid let's them all ride in his nice car until the cops come and he kicks everyone out and crashes the car trying to escape from the cops.\n\nIt was very good. The writing was poetic, rich, it makes sense that Cisneros' has also written poetry. The book does have a cool narrative structure, no strict plot but the narrator is growing up, and the house is a artefact: something constantly circled around."

                    "notes": "This was part of my Carolyn Forché binge, and it's her memoir about spending time in El Salvador prior to the civil war in the 1980s. She had spent some time in Spain translating the poetry of a Salvadorian poet, and then that person's cousin (or something) kind of randomly approached her when she was living in California, asking her to go with him to El Salvador to learn and document what was going on there. She went with him on several trips, visiting the campesinos, which I think are kind of like slums, but also meeting with generals and people working at hospitals. The whole time, and she's young btw, like in her 20s I think, she's not sure why he brought her. She keeps saying, I'm a poet, why will a general want to speak to me? But being a poet, and also an American, held a lot of weight. And she got to -- well, that implies a privilege, and I think that's unclear -- witness a lot of what was going on while this guy -- his name was Leonel -- was trying to help, he wanted to help the people trying to rise up against the government, which was (and as far as I can tell still is) cruel and corrupt.\n\nThe book is well-written, engrossing, dragged a bit in the middle, the ending is fascinating, through her experience in El Salvador she works on a photo book about the country (writing to accompany the photos) and meets a war photographer who had also spent a lot of time in El Salvador. They end up getting together and eventually marrying and having a kid and occasionally hosting Salvadorians that are on the run or trying to navigate America. It's interesting to see how these experiences -- which are hers but also seem to not quite belong to her, because she's American and has not ancestory in the Americans, her grandparents were frm eastern Europe I think -- are central but also peripheral to the rest of her life, where she is an American poet. She doesn't become Salvadorian.\n\nOne of the best things about this book was the acknowledgements. She acknowledges my uncle, David! So crazy. Fr. David Ungerleider. I knew he has worked a lot in Mexico but I didn't know he had any connection to El Salvador."

It follows a trans girl from rural Maine, who ended up being a part of an important civil rights case providing rights to transgender people. The main complaint was from I think her middle school, when a kid, clearly influenced by his grandfather, started bullying her and following her into the girls bathroom, saying if she can go (when she's 'actually a boy') then why can't he go into the girls bathroom too.\n\nFor me I think the most interesting thing was how easy it was for young children to accept her. They all just knew she was a girlboy, or a girl in a boy's body, or some other description that as five, seven, even ten years did not find strange at all. All this hate comes later, we pick it up from our parents (or grandparents) or other cultural things, but it seems like at our most basic we are totally accepting of anything.\n\nThe other thing that's interesting about Nicole is she is an identical twin, so it raises these interesting questions about the biological basis of transgenderism, because her brother isn't transgender."

The book is worn out, so I probably found it at a little free public library or something. While the stories had no real connecting thread, the theme seemed to be women in rural Canada dealing with their mothers or sisters. In one story a woman is visiting her sister, whose child recently died in a car accident, and the sister is so put together and procedural the woman feels out of place, unsure how to support. In another, a young woman is visiting her grandparents who are constantly complaining about the woman's mother, who has some kind of degenerate disease and can't take care of the house to the grandmother's satisfaction. It's about the history these women come from, and how that history bears on them and their expectations and actions. They are wonderful, very rich stories with a lot of interiority to them. And it wasn't really til after I was done that I realized how unusual it must be have been for Munro to be writing so well and detailed and caringly about women, with very little violence or action to drive the stories."

Rachel Carson is a beautiful writer, describing every part of the ocean in a breathtaking way, just filled with these almost throw-away lines about how the continents used to be barren and desolate before plants moved to land from the sea, about how all life started in the ocean with all its nutrients and our blood harkens back to this time of being immersed in something life-giving. She talks about the accumulation of sediments, why the ocean is salty, the origins of life, valleys and mountains under the ocean. It's just infinitely inspiring. I want to read the modern version, and she wrote this in the 1950s I think, and even this 'updated' version is from the 1960s. Like she presents an idea that the Pacific Ocean (named, by the way, by Magellan for how 'passive' it was in contrast to the Atlantic, which is named after the lost city of Atlantis) was formed because the mass that flung from the earth to form the moon came from the Pacific. This is.. probably not true (though it turns out we're still not exactly sure how the moon was formed) but beautiful and engaging none the less, and she does say it's a theory and they don't know. Anyway, I hope to read it again, or at least dip into it, highlight my favorite passages, and just be with it more."

Dogs can count, to an extent. They're good at detecting motion, but can't do as well when things don't move. Their vision is better in some ways and worse than others. Their nostrils have places to collect scent; this is part of what makes them so good at smelling. What else... positive training is just easier to do. Negative training works, but it's trickier and more likely to go wrong (e.g. associate with the wrong action)."

I feel it was popping around my circles during the BLM protests, when I was looking for engaging reads because I found reading so far. But for some reason I never got to it. Then I think talking to Hansa at some point and him saying he had read recently, and I'd just gotten back into ordering from the Cambridge public library (instead of the Brooklyn one) so I requested this and Detransition, Baby. They both came in at the same time and with surprisingly similar covers.\n\nThe Vanishing Half is about two twins, Desiree and Stella Vignes, light-skinned black girls in a middle of nowhere town in Louisiana called Mallard that's obsessed with being light-skinned. So they treat darker-skinned black people terribly, but they're also/still treated badly by white people. The girls' father is lynched in front of their eyes. When he doesn't die, the men go to the hospital and shoot him in the face. As teenagers the girls run away to New Orleans, and Stella ends up leaving her sister and passing as white, effectively for the rest of her life. Desiree does kind of the opposite---marries a very dark skinned guy and has a dark-skinned daughter, Jude. Stella marries a white guy and has a white-looking daughter Kennedy. The book follows this story, like Desiree getting beaten by her husband and eventually returning to Mallard with her daughter (who is treated like shit because she's so dark), working at the local diner for the next 20 years and taking care of her mother. Stella ends up in LA with a wealthy white husband and a kind of obnoxious daughter, and is pissed when a black family moves in across the street. At first she avoids them, and then ends up befriending the wife, and then eventually abandoning her again when the neighbors start whispering.\n\nSo there's the story of Stella and Desiree, and then there's the story of Jude and Kennedy. Jude happens upon Stella, and then Kennedy, in LA during undergrad, and every few years bothers Kennedy, trying to bring the lie of Stella to light, which eventually she does and Stella eventually (after many years) admits this to Kennedy.\n\nThen there's this weird transgender storyline about Jude's boyfriend, Reese. Hansa and I discussed this a bit. It's a bit obnoxiuos; there's a weird part about how Reese 'passes' as a man that doesn't really make sense as a parallel, and the drag queens they hang out with in LA, and Reese's underground testoterone usage, and eventual top-surgery. It's not that the plotline was bad, it was just kind of random and I think if you're gonna take it on then you need to take it on. And the passing bit was weird. I think there was potential---like looking at why Jude never tells her mother than Reese is trans (and this is why they don't get married). But it kind of weirdly focused in the issues of transition itself, which didn't make any sense as a parallel because the whole thing with Stella passing as white is that she didn't actually need to change at all.\n\nAnyway, I liked it, I read it quickly. It was a bit too neat and tidy, a bit too clean and clear, but I thought the parallels of the twins was nice, as was their mother's decent in Alzeimer's as a kind of reversion back to their childhood. It made me think I should read that book 'Passing' that was recently made into a movie."

This book was great because its characters were flawed, and had 'flawed' views, but the book dug into these tensions in the queer and trans communities, it let the characters think what we don't say out loud, and the characters had flaws but were making their way through the world as good people, doing their best. I thought the connection between trans women and cis divorced women was interesting. All the meditations on motherhood were fascinating. When do you get to feel like a mother? When is desiring motherhood the default, and when do you have to explain yourself? What does it mean to raise a child together?"

Topo's Bookstore was really amazing. Small, but with a really eclectic selection, lots of fun and weird and dark and queer zines and little things of art and a good selection of used (and some new) books. Also coffee and some snacks. I found this on the shelf just to the right of the door when you enter. After reading Hope in the Dark I knew I would get this one, especially since it was a bit cheaper because it was used.\n\nThis one, with its starting anecdote about a man trying to explain her own book to her, deals with gender-based violence. It came out in 2014, and I feel like... hm, what, that I knew it all but also maybe had forgotten it. My personal experience with sexism is more about dropping out of careers, men treating women poorly, but the book pointed to the spectrum being a man being mean to a man killing, and how shouldn't ignore the path between them. Or rather, need to acknowledge the links. While the mass murders in America are shocking and related to all kinds of things like access to weapons, they are also almost exclusively perpetrated by men. (My feeling is also white men, but I'm not sure.) And so it's one of those things like, yea, terrorism is bad, but so is crossing the road. So is being near a man.\n\nWhich is not to say things are 'getting better', and she's already written the hope book so this isn't someone who's uninterested in what has changed. But she is interested in how it is sidelined foro ther issues (like with mass murder) and how it's so ingrained as to feeling a bit like the air we breath."

They are, like his first book, deeply religious, though I feel they are more about America and empire than his first book. There are a series of poems called 'Pilgrim Bell' that use full stops throughout, like after every phrase and some every word, a kind of tolling of the poem, making it stilted and ringing. I feel like it's a lot more visually interesting than his first book, though I don't quite remember and I don't have it with me here in Vermont. He seems to be using more of the page, giving the words more space. It's less tightly wound. Not that it goes full experimental, and the voice is still distinctly his, the kind of collage of images making a gestalt that he does so well. But now he gives the collage space to breath, makes the links between them ... well gives us more space in the links between them. What does that do? It's the space between the bell tolls. Like the full stops in the Pilgrim Bell poems, the space acts as a marker of the beat."

While here, Tessa and Natasha both sang its praises, so it had a lot of build up but it met the expectations. I had no idea what it was about, I thought it was poetry, and it is, though it's called 'a novel in verse' I'd say it leans a bit more towards prose than poetry if only in that it has consistent characters and a loose narrative arc.\n\nThe story follows Geryon, ('Red' from the title), a young boy/red and winged monster, who, in the Greek myth, is killed as one of Hercules tasks. But this Geryon lives in the contemporary world, with cigarettes and hockey matches and buses to school, meeting Herakles (Hercules), and the whole thing is just very strange and wonderful in its blending of the ancient myth and modern time. \n\nI was very disappointed the Herakles doesn't kill Geryon at the end, as in the myth. Instead Herakles is a love interest, and later they meet again in Argentina (or Brazil?) and Herakles is with someone else (a photographer?) and in the end they all go to a volcano in Bolivia. It's blurbed as 'whimsical and haunting, ... richly layered and deceptively simple' and I think that's accurate. It's a fun read that feels like it has depth but you needed plunge into it if you don't want to."

He defines 'climate lyricism' as the reading of climate change in all literature, and the active attempt to write climate change into everything. The book is more about the former; I'm curious his thoughts on the latter. He also has this idea, at the beginning, that the best writing or activism about climate change should encourage us to participate more, rather than what most current work does which is make us want to sit it out. It didn't really follow up on this thought, but I loved the idea of action that encourages more action, and want to think about what this actually looks like, or what examples there are to exemplify it."

She never got back to me, but I enjoyed reading this (and another of her books). She definitely works in the theme of joy, and this was a lot about her children and grappling with their future and childlike joy with the dark realities of the world. She has a distinctive style, I'd say mostly simple, realistic poems where she muses on something she sees or feels. Most poems are just one or two pages long, single stanza with medium length lines, and the book becomes a gestalt of her reflections. It definitely felt like a later book, in that she has figured out her style and is refining it, making it more and more into herself rather than moving through many different styles or modes. I feel strange about this, I suppose it can come from certainty, but I often wonder about my own style, what it is, and if it's any good, because sometimes it strays from the contemporary mode and that makes me insecure. (Anne Boyer would berate me for this-- don't care about the contemporary mode, that's about taste. Instead, get at beauty.) Still, it's scary to walk down a less trodden path and not get much feedback; it's easier to do the more normal thing?"

My therapist actually had mentioned it, and being at VSC and seeing it at the bookstore there led me to buy it and read it. I read this before Fun Home, so I ended up reading her graphic novels (well, memoirs) in the opposite order she published/wrote them. With Superhuman Strength I thought the constant self-reflection and dive into literary history was part of that book, but it was with Are You My Mother that I started to see that's just Bechdel's thing, as it bringing all that meta-thought into the book's content itself. The book talks about the book getting written, showing opening pages to her mother, it spirals her own readings of psychoanalysis theory from its founders while also going to therapy herself and forming attachments to her therapists. Her mother somehow lacked something she needed, and she ended up looking for that in everyone -- hence the title, a constant querying for a mother figure she maybe felt she never really had. I'd need to read it again to remember all the theory she pulls in, the particular researcher she kind of intellectually falls in love with, and his particular theories able childrearing. From a writers view, it's an interesting construction: meta while also narrative driven, trying to pull the best of both of those modes."

The principal is a lesbian, and hearing but with Deaf parents, and there's a plotline about a kid from a well-known Deaf family who's parents have another kid who turns out to be hearing and how they all kind of are bummed about that and the dynamics of that whole thing."

Imagine American Pyscho but written by a woman who had actual empathy for her characters, and wanted to understand the perspective and mind of a man commiting such violence. Film noir, hard-boiled detective, following a guy who you learn is murdering women in LA, but befriends an old war friend who turns out to be a policeman on his case, and he revels in the cleverness of befriending the man who's out to get him. Eventually, though, of course, the policeman's wife figures it out, and traps him. It's a great look inside a deranged man, but also I felt some empathy, if only in the way emotions and moods can wash across the psyche, resulting in total miscontrual of reality, but it's this amazing portrait of how that works from the inside, how you can go from 'this is all great, i'm sure there are good reasons for this unexpected thing' to suddenly, 'everyone is conspiring against me and it is their fault'. Of course, most of us suffer this kind of thinking without hurting anyone as a result, so the empathy stops at some point, but the author's ability to let us access that kind of mind is amazing. Like American Psycho but good (and earlier!)"

Again, not sure how to describe this in a non-demeaning way.

It's kind of a question of if Stoner is just letting life happen to him, and if he should stand up for himself or his daughter or position (he runs afoul of a new dean, who makes his professional life hell), or if he is simply stoically bearing a hard life the best he came.

And yes, things in life are bad, but to just document and make an 'atlas' of shit falling apart... I don't know.

Thought it might be a bit outdated, because a lot of its examples are from several years ago when search engines and Google were quite different, but actually the criticism really holds up. Somewhat 'inspired' by Noble's experience googling things for her black nieces to do and getting mostly pornography, Noble takes a critical theory lens to search engines and outlines the problems when tech companies consider themselves and their products impartial and apolitical, despite there being no way to sort, organize, and prioritize information without being so. She also touches on library sciences and indexing practices as having similar problems to search engines, but search engines exasperate and repeat them, and can be more difficult to change as private companies are in control. (I feel I had a more nuanced and deeper appreciation of this book right after I read it; I'm probably six months out, which is why these notes might be a bit slim.)"

I was dubious at first, because the intro talks about AGI and alignment stuff, which I'm super not into, but it was actually pretty good and deep and wide. It talked about word embeddings, simple models for medical care, reinforcement learning, curiosity, and eventually got to safety and alignment issues at the end, mostly in toy cases but eventually getting to ethical altruism and William Macaskill, etc. etc. I don't really want to talk about that part too much, because I feel like it gets so much airtime and the issues of stuff like simple models that are explainable and the interesting interweave of reinforcement learning in CS and behavoiral shaping in psychology is much more interesting and relevant I think. I even think the toy problems with safety and alignment are interesting as they apply to real applications like self-driving and such; what's the best way to teach something? How do we avoid weird loopholes? What does it mean to embed values? (And we can think of values just as 'don't hit that object', doesn't have to be intense moral values.) Overall I found the book super well-researched, and quite deep. He had a whole part on the propublica breaking of the Compass recidivism software, and the resulting research on how you can't make all the fairness metrics work at the same time (I should really find the research on that part, it was super interesting), and how really decriminalizing a lot of stuff is better than trying to do predictive policing. So it was nice, I think, to see someone really dig into these issues and realize they're really socio-political ones, and not necessarily technical ones, a lot of the time."

What did I get out of it? Mostly that parenting isn't a competition, and going back to work is probably safer for people long-term, and women's bodies are often treated pre-natally even when they're not, and people without kids are probably legitimately happier than those with, at least for a while. She also gets into political issues, like how in US we blame ourselves for not staying home with our kids when we should be blaming the system for not subsidizing quality childcare. Kind of a typical, let's do collective action instead of individual striving, vibe, which is good, but didn't necessarily leave me with anything concrete."

I didn't love it at first, it had a similar, breath-y vibe to Never Let Me Go (which I never finished) and similarly I was frustrated by how much information about the world was being purposefully kept from me. It felt like looking at the world through gauze I just didn't know why, I didn't feel like it served a purpose, it went on too long for me. But I literally had nothing else to read and some down time at IBM with nothing else to do so I stuck with it and about half way through it did start to get more interesting, when we realize the 'portrait' of Josie is actually an AF and that Klara would be asked to inhabit and 'become' Josie if Josie dies. This suddenly made the book much more interesting than Klara's continual slightly-lacking understanding of a world the reader also doesn't know quite enough about. So I'm glad I stuck it through, because the idea of replacement was actually kind of interesting, seeing the mother want it as a kind of balm and also acknowledging that many people wouldn't accept it, not because Klara wouldn't be able to replicate Josie but because the knowledge of her not being Josie would get in the way of their love. So that was a fun idea. But I just can't really stand his writing, and probably reading a precis of the book would have given me 90% of what I got out of reading the whole thing."

This was on it, and it's the most artsy of the books I found, I think, a manifesto for taking the idea of glitch -- failings, errors, strangeness -- as a guiding principle for feminism to push against the norms of society. It's good, a little inside-the-art-world, with lots of references, but I liked the idea of seeing error or strangeness as a way to reclaim ourselves as important."

It's a recent book, maybe somewhat autofictiony (in the notes she says the dialog in the book with Ray is mostly unchanged from her own dialog with real Ray.) It's a fun, strange book, with 'heart-stepping' cows, and her swollen feet talking as two characters from a Flaubert novel. The central line of the book is the narrator's need to escape from these letters her father had given her when she was a teenager which her brother recently sent to her as part of cleaning out the house. The letters, which are revealed only towards the end, are bad but crazy bad, and I think there's this great tension in the book about what's considered legit and who gets to claim scapegoat status and how insidious things can be fucked up and fuck people up."

First part is too breathy, somehow written in a weird present tense I don't know the word for but has a lot of 'has' as in, They have been doing X, like present tense but also past. Also a lot of collective third person, making it super nostalgic and weird to read. Almost gave up about a quarter in but then it got interesting, following Sarah and David at an elite theatre school in LA, and Mr. Kingsley's making public of their private (tho high school so not that private affair). Then the English theatre class coming, and Sarah's brief sex with Liam. THEN the second part turns the whole first part on its head as a book written by Sarah, loosely based on her real experiences, and Karen, a character from the book, Sarah's actual best friend from high school, reading the book (and stopping partway?) and eventually acting out revenge on the teacher from the English theatre students who returns amidst sexual assault scandals to perform a play. We learn Karen got pregnant by Martin (the English teacher) in high school and ended up giving the kid up for adoption. This section is also written weirdly, but more enjoyably, in a mixed first- and third-person, as if Karen is trying to tell her own story from a distance. Final, tiny last part is from the perspective of Karen's kid, who is trying to find her birth parents, and in the process gets assaulted by a teacher from the theatre school. I had trouble placing that character; was he mentioned in the prior parts? He also but not quite fit the description of Mr. Kingsley, except not gay and Mr. Kingsley wasn't portrayed as an aggressor but maybe that was due to the perspective of the respective parts narrators, and not the truth."

I didn't love this book for the first third... it was okay, enjoyable  but didn't pull me along like some novels, and wasn't stylistically or structurally interesting. Still, I stuck with it, and really enjoyed it at the end, almost crying at one point. Follows two girls who become friends in primary school in LA, and follows their lives up til their forties, with some stretches apart (Fiona is in New York City for several years) where they don't talk too much. It really did center their friendship, though in the way friendship is so centered in many lives, it's a sideline but it's also a constant. Some details to help jog your memory: it opens with Jane visiting her father in Taiwan; he's decided to stay because he's realized he's gay and has fallen in love. Jane outs him to her mother, and feels responsible for his suicide many many years later. Jane's bi, and her first foray with a girl is with her piano teacher Ping. Fiona is raised by a single mother, who got pregnant by a college kid back in Taiwan but never told the father about the pregnancy. Fiona goes to UC Berkeley, and then NYU Law, drops out, but eventually many years later finishes up at UCLA. Jane never really does college, and ends up managing an apartment building in LA. Fiona dates Jasper during college, then goes with him to New York; he's a writer. Their close friend Kenji gets cancer. Jasper cheats on Fiona, but wants to figure it out; Fiona doesn't and we never really see why she won't. Fiona later on in LA marries Aaron, who also cheats on her I think. They get married quick, then divorced. Later she marries... who. Barry? Bobby. Jane dates a white girl called Carly for a while; Won helps Jane get over her. Later on we see Jane form a relationship with Julian, an ex marine, and Naima, a black screen writer. I forget if we get any of Jane's relationships in between... Anyway, in some ways the book is just these vignettes about their lives at different points, and I don't think they're all 100% in order, but it's most chronological. At the end Fiona is married with a kid, and Jane is thinking about getting serious with Naima, but it ends with them together, Jane getting over her guilt about her father, and suggesting she write a novel about Jane and Fiona's relationship. Kind of a cutsie ending, but it worked."

For some reason I turned to her again, probably because of my interest in autofiction, and found this at the library; the first page seemed good so I took it home. I really liked it. The narrator was compelling, this anxiety about authenticity and how to be herself was captivating, as was her relationship with Margauex (sp?) the painter. (It was a book about female friendship! Truly!) The only parts I didn't like were her detailing her relationship with Israel, which I found... not disturbing, but just... eh, it bothered me that she was so into ceding sexual control, even though it made sense with her whole anxiety about how to make choice and 'how to be'. Still, I didn't want her to succumb to this super traditional girl stereotype, and I didn't see her really interrogate that except adjacently. Also maybe I didn't like knowing if Israel really knew what was going on, was concious of his behavior, like was he playing into a kink or did he think girls just like that? I guess I didn't like that it was unclear if there was really consent. Anyway, the rest of it was super interesting, and now I'm curious to go back to Motherhood."

Super strange story about a woman who is perfectly happy to work at a convenience store for the rest of her life, though everyone in her life is concerned that she hasn't gotten a real job, nor any prospects for a husband or family. She enjoys the store because it's clear how she is meant to act and what she is meant to do; she's constantly trying to figure out what other people want from her, who all seem to be very concerned that's she's not 'cured'. She has a lean towards violence, that she represses because she sees it causes other people distress; as a child she hits a boy on the head with a spade because everyone wanted him to stop fighting, but she didn't understand why concussing him wasn't a reasonable solution. It seems like no one really understands her, maybe today or in the US we'd call her austistic and maybe be able to have a truly shared conversation about how she differs from others, but instead everyone just cries about how weird she is and she does her best to fit in, without abandoning what she wants, which mostly seems to be to serve the convenience store. I think there's a tension in the book about if we should read the narrator as a psychopath or a metaphor for not fitting in. I liked it; I found the narrator captivating, and it was a super quick read (I read it all in one night) and had plenty to think about when it was over."

It kind of felt like watching a movie while you're falling asleep: there just wasn't enough information coming into to ever know what was happening.

Anyway, so I wanted to read a bunch of books on form, after I got the strain and took some time off and went back to running and got the strain again. I looked up lists of books on form and picked out the four that seemed most relevant. I knew I had read Chi Running before, and had gotten rid of my copy in one of my book purges. Luckily Rodrigo had taken it and still had it! Rereading it, I started to remember it again: lead from the hips, keep the upper body straight and tall, lean forward to run faster, let the legs drop below the center of mass and pick them up behind you, rather than try to propel the legs forward. Keep the pelvis flat, don't let it tip up. Land midfoot (I don't think this is necessary all the time). Swing the arms back, and don't let them cross the midline. Keep you cadence constant and lengthen your stride to go faster. All good things, and I enjoyed rereading it and reminding myself of the ideas and paying attention to those ideas while running."

Dreyer is pretty prescriptive: he's found a good form, you should follow it too. Dicharry talks a lot about diversity in runners; the same form won't work for everyone, because everyone has a different body. Dicharry focuses on the importance of cross-training and strengthening exercises, and how different deficiencies can cause injuries. He criticizes the Rest Ice Compress Elevate framework, and the idea that runners can just take time off running to let an injury to heal and not expect the injury to come back---instead we need to think about what caused the injury (often form or some kind deficiency) and correct that, as well as include exercise that helps healing. He goes into bone, cartilege, tendons, muscle, describing how they each contribute and work and might be harmed or healed. Muscles need some exercise to heal them, otherwise they just atrophy. At the end he has a series of tests to look for common deficiencies in runners; I failed the hip flexor test (most people do, because sitting a lot causes tight hip flexors) and the hamstring flexibility test (he says that, from lying on your back, you should be able to lift your leg to at least 70 degrees with minimal feeling of stretch; since my right hamstring injury I've avoided stretching my hamstrings basically ever so now they're kind of tight). Interestingly, I'm pretty sure I read this back when I was dating Oscar, I just forgot all about it! So even though I got my copy from the library, after I read it I bought a used copy online using Alibris, so I can keep it as a reference book."

He does report on studies, and lots of quotes from runners and coaches and scientists, but the whole thing was a bit more diffuse. At the end he offers up some running advice that he thinks cuts across the board, and it's good stuff like 'run tall', and 'run soft', things that you can try to achieve but also do what you want (rather than things like changing how you strike the ground which won't necessarily shift your body mechanics the way you expect)."

                    "notes": "Brad recommended this to me as the book he read to learn how to swim. I really liked the idea of it, a focus on form because drag is such a big deal in swimming that reducing drag will make you much faster than swimming harder, and that by working on your form you're gain the strength you want along the way. I found the exercises at the end less exciting, they just felt kind of unnecessary, I felt like I could implement a lot of his ideas just by being conscious of my form while swimming. I guess I also don't feel my form is holding me back too much, and I don't care too much about speed (or even necessarily efficiency). Anyway, he talks about the importance of keeping your hips up (obvious) and that you need to press your chest down (I find this is easeist by looking down more) to get your hips to buoy up. Then the idea of gliding forward with the arm out ahead, as if you're trying to fit your body through the smallest hole it can go. The hips and torso should shift quite a lot, because there's less drag on your side than on your front, and your legs don't need to kick that much. I read some critiques online that the book is great for getting you into swimming, but eventually if you want to go faster it's not necessarily the fastest form. Anyway, I got a lot out of it, even if I didn't end up doing the drills."

                    "notes": "Read this for the Laura/Hansa/et al book club. About a guy who gets hit by something in a freak accident he can't talk about, because he receives a huge (8.5 million pound) settlement to never discuss it. But the accident puts him in the hospital and PT for months, relearning how to walk and pick things up. He comes out of it kind of empty, not remembering much of his past, not sure what to do with all his money. He's concerned with authenticity, and how he doesn't feel real, but when he watches a movie with his friend he says the actors seem so authentic, everything they do so perfect, which his friend disagrees with, no, the actors are fake! No one is perfect like that. Still, the narrator is so unsure of himself, and finds his actions empty. At a party he goes to the bathroom and notices a crack along the wall; it brings back to him a vivid memory he can't quite place of being in a flat with the smell of cooked liver coming up through the window, and a pianist practicing a piece, and red sloping roofs on the apartment building next door he can see from the window, with black cats lazing about. He goes about using his money to recreate this memory perfectly: acquiring a renovating a building, hiring people to act. He feels most real and authentic when he relives (re-enacts) this memory, which he can practice and perfect and experiece over and over again, or slower this time. He then starts to re-enact other things: an experience he has getting his car fixed, a shooting that happens near the auto shop, eventually a bank robbery. It escalates; he wants to re-enact the bank robbery but for real, at a real bank; Naz, the man who makes everything happen for him, notes that they can't tell the re-enactors, that they might have to kill them afterwards to keep the reality of the situation safe. The narrator is clearly going mad, losing track of reality or stopping to care for reality much at all. In the bank robbery re-enactment that's actually real, a man trips and falls, because in the recreation they made there was a wrinkle in the rug; in reality there is no wrinkle, but the re-enactor had practiced falling on the wrinkle; without the wrinke he falls for real, accidentally pulling the trigger on his gun and shooting another re-enactor. The re-enactors start to freak, realizing it's real, escaping to the warehouse, where the narrator re-enacts the trip and really shoots another man... Naz and the narrator are attempting to escape via private jet, but get called back by the control station; the narrator tells them to keep going, says to say that it's a hijacking, thinking in some way that he's acting out the hijacking, rather than doing the hijacking, or maybe he's stopped telling the difference. He asks them to turn back, but then turn back again, doing figure of eights, and we end in this moment of suspension, like a moment earlier in the book where he's going to pick up a friend from the airport and keeps turning to go home and then turning to go to the train because he can't decide if he needs to go get her plane number. The book is strange, an exploration not, I think, of happiness (as someone blurbed it to be about) but of authenticity and reality. What makes us feel in the moment? Perhaps the narrator stopped having moments to be in. Strangely his idea of feeling authentic is the opposite of most, I think, who find authenticity in spontaneity. Instead he finds it in rehearsal, which is the only time he feels real, perhaps because through his PT he stopped feeling like normal actions, walking, eating, where easy; instead they demanded his attention. What does it mean to live a life where spontaneity or presence can only happen in a completely controlled and pre-defined situation? Interested to talk to people about it. I'm not sure I actually liked the book, I just find it fascinating."

This book lives a lot in nature, though I love the poem in which she describes how she used to not care about birds, blue bird, black bird, blah blah blah bird. There is one poem about not being a mother, but mostly the book centres on daily life, parents/grandparents/ancestory, love, sadness, the typical poetry beats, though of course Limón is doing it so well they don't feel normal, they don't feel typical."

The poems are good; lots of nature poems, poems about children, for the most part that kind of clarity and poignancy I expect in poetry, though the long whale fall poem is more askance, harder to follow the 'plot', though mixed with science and other learnings that I enjoyed.

It's very much steeped in women's / queer / gender studies, which is something I've never personally studied but I enjoy reading about. I liked the anecdote about a Renaissance researcher who, after having a child, finds her research to be incredibly boring in comparison, but, after two years, returns to finding her work interesting again."

It's well-written, though I found some of the mathematical explanations not that easy to follow, and covers a wide range of machine creations: alphago, image recognition and generation (deep dream), language generation, music generation, and the one I knew least about, mathematics. My feeling was that the book was too broad and surface level, but also I know a lot about this stuff so maybe for another reader it was just right. And I did get something out of it; though I had heard of most of what he talked about, there was occasionally something I hadn't heard of, which is always good. There was one text generation project, a NaNoGenMo entry, that he described as giving some insight into a machine trying to make sense of text from Wikipedia. At the end of the book he has a similar take to me---art is a communicative act that requires intention and experience and propulsion and computers don't have that---and what he liked about the NaNoGenMo project was it gave some insight into the 'mind' of the machine. Hm, what else. He seemed to be back and forth on if a computer could be creative, on one hand seeming to say yes, clearly they create impressive artifacts, and on the other claiming humans can be the only true source. But I guess that's the truth."

I liked the first part a lot, where she describes writers as having a need to write, and that writing gives back very little, so only those who really feel the need tend to end up going for it. She talks about the need to write what you are going to write, and that no one can really tell you what to write, and chasing fads is useless, so you might as well do your own thing. She gets into drugs and mental illness; slightly less interesting to me, and here the book began to drag a bit, lots of stories about writers who did and didn't self-promote. I mean, basically there's a million ways to carve the cow (or whatever that idiom is), and it's interesting really only as comfort and maybe a bit of confidence that your way (my way?) has a good a chance of any. It got a little more interesting toward the end, with the details of publishers and editors and publicists, but I think nothing too too new or unknown for me. I was on a plane while reading it, I didn't have much choice, but I also felt some compulsion to finish it, because there were good gems and so when it dragged I was hopefully it might shine again, and it often did, if not as often as I wanted."

I found the first section really frustrating; he seems to randomly define creativity (apparently he's a creativity researcher?) with a bunch of attributes and then gives anecdotes of famously 'creative' people to back it up. But all the creative people are dead white guys. The only contemporary people he talks about are tech CEOs, as if Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos are the creative geniuses of our generation. He mentions maybe Emily Dickinson? And some 'husband-and-wife' teams. Anyway, so I thought that part was shit. But it was a short part at the start. Most of the book reads like a summary of talking to a bunch of different people in AI art, which is pretty interesting and he did talk to a lot of people across a lot of different mediums and genres. He always ends a chapter with whether that person thinks computers can be creative or not. Then the last section is some research on consciousness and why he thinks computers will soon become conscious and truly be creative like people. He had this whole thing about thinking it's good for computers to be creative, even more creative than people, but I didn't quite understand why he was so excited about the singularlity. Anyway, worth reading, but not really my cup of tea."
